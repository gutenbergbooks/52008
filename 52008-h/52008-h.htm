  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The following pages do not afford any
material additions to what is already known
of Dante Rossetti, or of the history and
purpose of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The
authoritative biography of Rossetti has yet to be
written; and while availing myself fully of such
new details as may cast fresh side-lights upon the
dominant personalities of the Pre-Raphaelite movement,
my aim has rather been to present the main
features of that movement in their relation to the
larger intellectual tendencies of the age, and to the
moral principles which have determined the growth
of taste and feeling in the nineteenth century. To
this end I have avoided as far as possible the
proper domain of the art critic, and endeavoured
to deal with the Pre-Raphaelite movement more as
an ethical than an æsthetic revolution.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was always known to be Rossetti’s wish,”
says Mr. Hall Caine in his interesting and
graphic “Recollections of Rossetti,” “that if at any
moment after his death it should appear that the
story of his life required to be written, the one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>friend who during many of his later years knew
him most intimately, and to whom he unlocked the
most sacred secrets of his heart, Mr. Theodore
Watts, should write it; unless indeed it were
undertaken by his brother William.  But though
I know that whenever Mr. Watts sets pen to paper
in pursuance of such a purpose and in fulfilment
of such charge, he will afford us a recognizable
portrait of the man, vivified by picturesque illustration,
the like of which few other writers could
compass, I also know from what Rossetti often
told me of his friend’s immersion in all kinds
and varieties of life, that years (perhaps many
years) may elapse before such a biography is
given to the world.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meantime, the present writer is indebted
to Mr. J.A. Vinter, Rossetti’s fellow-student at the
Royal Academy Schools, for some interesting
reminiscences of class-room and studio life, and to
the Rev. Walter Tuckwell, rector of Stockton,
Rugby, for personal recollections of the Pre-Raphaelites
at Oxford. Mr. Gerald Massey has
also assisted with suggestions and notes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through the courtesy of present owners of
Rossetti’s pictures, several important drawings and
studies are here engraved for the first time. Lord
Battersea and Overstrand has kindly permitted a
photograph to be made from the sketch in his possession,
“Mary Magdalene at the Door of Simon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>the Pharisee.” A similar privilege has been
granted by the Corporation of Birmingham in regard
to their monochrome, “The Boat of Love,”
and the beautiful unfinished study of “Our Lady
of Pity.” I have also to acknowledge the kindness
of Mr. Moncure D. Conway, in giving access to
the fine study of the “Head of Christ” in his collection,
and, by no means least, of Mr. Theodore Watts,
in the matter of his two superb crayons, “The
Day-dream” and “Pandora.” The “Beata
Beatrix” and “Ecce Ancilla Domini” are from
the now familiar paintings in the National Gallery.</p>

<p class='c005'>A study of the Pre-Raphaelite movement
in England at the zenith of the nineteenth
century opens up perhaps a wider field for
controversy in the ethics of art than is afforded by
any other phase of modern painting. Between the
ridicule which, for the most part, greeted Rossetti’s
first picture, “The Girlhood of Mary Virgin,” in
1849, and the enthusiastic homage which exalted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>him, thirty years later, to the dominance not merely
of a school, but almost of a religion, lies a ground
of infinite question and dispute, still awaiting the
historian who shall adjust the issues of the strife
to the main thought-current of the period.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In thirty years,” said Constable in 1821,
“English art will have ceased to exist.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The words were significant of that first stirring
of weariness and discontent which precedes either
a collapse or a revolution. It was impossible that
the conventions of the eighteenth century, persisting
in pictorial art long after they had been
cast off by literature, should suffice for an age
which had wholly outgrown the conceptions of life
on which they were founded. Landscape and
portraiture, however enriched by the last gleams
of a flickering classicism in the genius of a Turner,
a Lawrence, or a Constable, were still in the
“bondage of corruption” to traditional schools.
Turner, indeed, is too great to be bracketed with
his contemporaries, or with the pioneers of the
Pre-Raphaelite movement. He stands as much
alone as Titian. But the thrall of the conventional,
of the accepted canons of what should be perceived
and conceived, and how things ought to look in
pictures, lay yet upon English art. One other
painter, a solitary and uncouth herald of the new
day, holds a unique position in that transition
period. Blake alone, working his fantastic will like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>a sanctified Rabelais run riot in all supernal things,
discerned weird glimpses of the coming light;
such glimpses as Chatterton, in the world of
poetry, caught brokenly before the neo-romantic
dawn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Posterity may decide that the catastrophe thus
prophesied by Constable was only averted by the
grafting of an Italian genius upon English stock,
and that to the country of the Great Renaissance
England owes—at least in the field of painting—her
own Renaissance of the nineteenth century.
Spontaneous as was the impulse of revolt in
kindred minds, and worthily as it issued in the
hands of others, the supreme achievement of the
Pre-Raphaelite movement abides with Dante
Gabriel Rossetti. Without him there might have
been—and indeed was already begun—a breaking
up of the old pictorial conventions; an experiment
both significant and fruitful in contemporary art.
Failing this ready soil, the genius brought over by
Rossetti from a Latin race could hardly have been
naturalized as it was in early life by interchange of
thought and method with fellow-schismatics from
the English schools. But whether that vital change
of spirit which found its fullest expression in the
Pre-Raphaelite movement would have produced
anything like its present results independently of
Rossetti, is a question still entangled in that injudicial
partisanship of opinion from which no contemporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>judgment can quite shake itself free.
A final estimate of Rossetti’s debt to his comrades,
and of the original and intrinsic merit both of their
own work and of his, is beyond the reach of the
present century. Meanwhile, a verdict of no inconsiderable
weight is available in the words of
Ruskin: “I believe <a id='corr4'></a><ins class='correction' title='sic'>Rosetti’s</ins> name should be
placed first on the list of men who have raised and
changed the spirit of modern art; raised in absolute
attainment, changed in the direction of
temper.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Probably, if one were called upon to name a
score of typical pictures of the Pre-Raphaelite
School, the first rough catalogue rising to the lips
would be strangely inadequate to the question.
Rossetti’s “Girlhood of Mary Virgin,” “Ecce Ancilla
Domini,” “Found,” “Beata Beatrix,” “Dante’s
Dream,” and “The Blessed Damozel;” Madox
Brown’s “The Last of England,” “The Entombment,”
and “Romeo and Juliet;” Holman Hunt’s
“Christ in the Temple,” “The Scapegoat,” and
“The Light of the World;” Millais’s “Eve of
St. Agnes,” “A Huguenot,” and “Ophelia;”—these,
if among the most familiar to English eyes, are but
a small fraction of the product of that fruitful thirty
years, leaving altogether out of count the later and
important work of G.F. Watts and E. Burne-Jones,
to say nothing of such worthy adherents as Arthur
Hughes, James Collinson, Henry Wallis, Walter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Deverell, J.M. Strudwick, and others who fairly
claim the shadow of the Pre-Raphaelite wing. Yet
even in so imperfect a group the student may read
at least the dominant features of the painting, and
especially in the work of Dante Gabriel Rossetti.
Here for the first time in English art is <em>colour</em>
supreme, triumphant, as in Titian; <em>form</em> ethereal
and chastened, like the visions of a Fra Angelico;
<em>subjects</em>, rather than objects, set forth in so direct
and often crude an imagery; not figures merely,
but symbols; fragments of human history, actual
and urgent, full of problems and wonders, weighty
with meanings and desires. The draped and
ordered models of the past—the Ladies Sophia,
Elizabeth, and Lavinia as the three Graces, and
the Countess Agatha as a species of Muse—have
given place to a new “dream of fair women,” not
posing or self-conscious, but as if caught and painted
unaware; knights like young monks, sad-eyed but
alert in a rapt sobriety; Madonnas more human
than angelic, with the sweet cares of womanhood
upon them all; Christs neither new-born nor dying,
but seen in full child-life and manhood, artless and
simple and strong. Here, certainly, is the utterance
of men who if they have not looked broadly over
life have at least seen deeply into it, and concerned
themselves not so much with its rare crises as with
the permanent conditions and problems of human
experience.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>It is easily argued that all criticism, all appreciation
even, resolves itself ultimately into a question
of temperament. To some minds, and these not
the least discriminate, the very limitations and
extravagances of Pre-Raphaelitism appeal with a
peculiar force. There are whole aspects of life
which Romance, if it touch, can never transfigure.
The passionate, brooding loveliness of Rossetti’s
women, the remote and subtle pathos of Holman
Hunt, the dreamy and yet vivid tenderness of
Millais’s earlier style,—these are not qualities of
universal charm: they are the outcome of special
moods and conditions which find neither voice nor
answer save in the channels they themselves create.
It is only given to a rarely catholic genius—a
Shakespeare, a Handel, or a Raphael—to move,
as it were, the broad currents of common feeling,
and to command the general sympathies of the
educated world. Artists of more distinctive and
personal quality—a Shelley in poetry, a Chopin
in music, or a Rossetti in painting—will rather gain
each an elect circle of interpreters through whom
to sway less immediately the thought of their
generation; the more so since in the realm of the
fine arts is felt most potently the growing tendency
to specialize both thought and utterance in the
tension of modern life. “Our age,” it has been
aptly said, “has seen a specialization of emotions
as well as of studies and industries. Let us not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>then expect all things from any man. Let us
welcome the best representative of every mood of
the mind.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The private life of Dante Gabriel Rossetti,
though leaving to those who loved him an inexhaustible
harvest of tender and pathetic memories,
was outwardly uneventful enough, save for the one
romance and tragedy of his early manhood by
which he is vaguely known to the outer world. But
behind the veil of recordable history, few artists have
suffered greater mental vicissitudes in a lifetime of
half a century, or have lived at such high spiritual
pressure and imaginative strain. London-born and
London-bred though he was, the force of his Italian
parentage and temperament isolated him—save for
a very few congenial spirits—in an alien world;
and though his work in painting and poetry was
largely Saxonized by training and environment, the
man himself was oppressed with the burden of an
imagination steeped in the very soul of mediæval
Florentine romance. His whole nature was overstrung
and at the mercy of physical and social
“weather.” Memory, daily experience, his own
conceptions and creations in design and poetry,
small incidents of life woven by his own feverish
brain into actual calamity, possessed him with a
power simply incomprehensible to the average
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>mind. Like Sir Bedevere, striding from ridge to
ridge in Lyonness,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“His own thought drove him like a goad.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>At the last, his death, it has been affirmed by
Mr. Theodore Watts, was due but indirectly to
physical disease; primarily to the prolonged and
terrible fervour of writing “The King’s Tragedy.”
Out of such conditions of artistic expression came
a depth and intensity of feeling incompatible with
wide versatility or range of vision. Such a temperament
must either specialize or achieve nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it is the business of the historian to look
behind temperament towards the deep and primal
impulses of a nation and a century. To him
the sum of temperaments becomes the spirit of
an age; or rather, the nation itself, in the grasp
of the age, is conceived as a living, thinking,
struggling personality; complex, problematic, self-contradictory,
but strong to inspire the same
loyalties, the same aspirations, as the old world
found in Rome, or mediæval Europe in the great
mother-cities which were at once her burden and
her pride. To study a temperament like Rossetti’s
in its relation to the intellectual life of the age,
and to ask how such a temperament was in its
turn brought to bear upon some of the problems
of that life, is to be confronted with much more
than a personality or a career; is to deal with a
wide and crucial phase in the history of a people.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>For the Pre-Raphaelite movement was much
more than a revolution in the ideals and methods
of painting. It was a single wave in a great
reactionary tide—the ever rising protest and rebellion
of our century against artificial authority,
against tradition and convention in every department
of life. It broke out, socially, with the
French Revolution; it found voice in the poetic
impulse which followed it in Coleridge, Shelley,
and Keats; it spread from ethics to politics, it
touched all morality and all knowledge, and it
affected the whole literature of Europe from philosophy
to fiction and from the drama to the lyric
poem. Schumann and Chopin breathed it into
music; Darwin, re-forming the world of science,
laid in the doctrine of evolution the foundations
of the new cosmogony. It remained for painting,
the youngest of the arts, to enter last into the van
of progress and take its stand against the classic and
orthodox scholasticism now discredited and void.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not that the classicism of eighteenth century
art was without a beauty and a meaning of its
own. It was at least the relic of a noble ideal,
the outworn garment of a spirit once vigorous and
sincere. The true classic temper—the mental
ordering of the visible world into types and models
according to academic rule—is the natural
outgrowth of man’s effort to select and classify
those objects around him which it gives him pleasure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>to contemplate. The “choosing-spirit” of
an age—its preference for certain aspects of life
and indifference to other aspects—embodies itself
in set forms and modes of artistic expression
which are accepted by that age as sufficient and
final, and stereotyped by common usage into conventions
from which, in the progress of a growing
people, all vitality gradually ebbs away. Just as
in science or philosophy the theories and methods
of authoritative men are established as “classic”
till fresh facts and fresh problems come to light,
so in literature, in music, and in painting, certain
types and modes are adopted by general consent
as the fit vehicles for the thought to be expressed,
and these persist, by force of authority and usage,
into a new age bringing new ideas into play and
seeing the <em>subject-matter</em> of all art—namely life
itself—in a new light. Thus the accepted canons
of art, which were at first the natural reflection of
the highest culture of the period, become at last
the barren dogmas of an outgrown habit of mind.
The thought of the people has outrun the language
of the schools. The strife of the new
thought with the old language is begun.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a strife it was that came upon the western
world under the outward turmoil of the French
Revolution. Europe was in the mood for great
reactions. The vast and sordid materialism of
the eighteenth century, with its prodigious hypocrisies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and its flippant sensuality,—its sentimentality
even, which, as Heine reminds us, is always
a product of materialism—was rudely broken up.
The disruption of the settled order of worldly
things awoke men’s dormant questions as to the
divine order of things, the moral government of
the universe. Or rather, the rejection of external
authority was but the evidence of the rejection
of authority within—the rejection of traditional
standards of right and wrong, beauty and happiness,
wisdom and truth; and the demand for new
standards for the criticism of life, for new ethics,
new ideals, new gods.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now the pure and lofty classicism of the seventeenth
century, as exemplified supremely in the
poetry of Milton, was saved from materialism by
the robust piety of a Puritan world. It was not
until the beginning of the eighteenth century,
when the accession of imperial and commercial
power brought with it a certain coarsening of the
moral fibre of the nation, that the “grand” style
became petrified, as it always tends to do, into the
grandiose. A people nurtured in the somewhat
tawdry luxury of the Hanoverian period was not
likely to take very serious views of life, but was
well content with superficial philosophies. In the
blaze of outward prosperity the inward vision
grew dim. Art became the slave of tradition instead
of the handmaid of a living will.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Then the great wave of rebellion, surging
through the life of Europe, swept into the deep
backwaters of imaginative and creative thought.
Men born into the storm and stress of revolution,
and confronted with the great problems of practical
life, were driven back to question ultimate things;
were thrown once more upon the spiritual world.
And as the outward struggle spent itself, its full
significance weighed more upon the peoples. The
deep charm of the contemplative, the reflective, the
critical, fell once more upon the European mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>So the “classic” temper—the love of order and
authority (degraded at last into mere acceptance of
tradition and rule)—gave place to the “romantic”
temper,—the temper of enquiry and experiment,
the sense of the mystery and the reality of life, the
openness of the mind towards spiritual things. And
with this new consciousness of the invisible world
and all its significance upon the life of man, comes
the utter discarding of <em>self</em>-consciousness; the repudiation
of “pose.” Life has become too real
for attitudinizing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first result of this change of spirit upon the
art of a nation appears in the choice of subject for
artistic treatment. The painter begins to portray
not merely things and persons but incidents and
conditions; to picture men and women as they are
in actual life; in short, to <em>state the problems</em>
fairly; to see facts and examine circumstances, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>order to reach the solutions and the meanings,
vaguely guessed and earnestly desired by the soul
awakened to the perception of the supernatural
and the divine. This was the initial task of the
neo-romantic revival; in this lay the primary
significance of the new school of painting which
appeared soon after the year 1845 on English
exhibition walls.</p>

<p class='c000'>And to do this it became necessary to set out,
as it were, the <em>terms</em> on which life is lived; to deal
not merely with the beauty which man loves and
the joy which he desires, but also with the stern
conditions of their attainment. The struggle between
the present evil and the recognized good,
the conflict of the soul with earthly bonds, Love
baffled in dire cross-currents of fate and duty, or
wasted and despoiled in sin, Faith shaken by the
storms of circumstance, Hope bowed down before
the closing doors of death; and, on the other hand,
the glory of consummated joys (though never
without the under-thought of their transiency), or
the strength of human fidelity and endurance—these
are the themes of the second renaissance.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is hardly surprising that the considerable
class of critics (more numerous in the eighteen-forties
than to-day) to whom all seriousness is
melancholy and all mystery painful, should have
dismissed much of the Pre-Raphaelite work under
the inaccurate label of “pessimism.” To bring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the mood of awe, of sadness, of perplexity, into
art at all, and more especially to present serious
themes with the directness of familiar life, and
without the stage-craft glamour of the heroic and
the exceptional, is, in the judgment of such
persons, to be indisputably a pessimist. Yet from
this standpoint we should have to exclude no
small part of the greatest art the world has ever
seen. If we accept Heine’s dictum that no man
is truly a man until he suffers, we shall call no
nation great in art until it is great in tragedy.
There comes with every awakening of an age
(whether in ancient Greece, Elizabethan England,
or mediæval Italy) to problems new to the world
at large, or which the preceding age had lost
sight of, a straining of the vision towards ultimate
meanings and purposes. And the cry for light is
answered often by a lurid dawn.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the temper of Pre-Raphaelitism differs both
from that of Greek tragedy (in being essentially
romantic and ascetic), and from the mediæval
mysticism of which it is to some extent a revival.
However sincerely Rossetti and his comrades may
have found their inspiration in the early and
purest period of the Italian Renaissance (as we
shall have to consider in examining the name
“Pre-Raphaelite”), it was impossible, in the
middle of the nineteenth century, to return absolutely
to the mediæval habit of mind. All that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>was best in the romance of the middle ages, the
passionate idealism, the abiding sense of the
reality of the unseen, the self-abandonment of
devotion to the transcendental and the super-sensuous
life, the exquisite childlikeness of spirit
which comes of the highest maturity—all these
indeed were regained, but with a difference. For
the enigma of the universe, regarded by the
mediæval world as a mystery of faith, has come
upon our own age rather as a mystery of doubt.
The silence of the natural world towards man’s
eagerest questionings of the Power behind it, was
to those pious souls only the holy reticence of an
all-wise and all-sufficient God. They accepted
with a brave resignation what the modern world
endures with a no less courageous but far less
trustful mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Therefore the much-debated mysticism of the
Pre-Raphaelite School carries with it a deeper
sombreness than that of a purely mediæval type,
and makes the relations between man and external
Nature more problematic and obscure. The
sense of the impassive irony of Nature behind the
little drama of man’s life on earth comes again
and again into the dim vistas of landscape behind
Rossetti’s loveliest women, and into the mingling
of scenic grandeur with an atmosphere of desolation
in some of the backgrounds of Holman Hunt.
Even Millais, the least subjective of the Brotherhood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>achieves, in “The Vale of Rest,” something
of that subtle contrast, half discord and half harmony,
between the glory and absolute peace of
sunset and the dumb unquestionable night of
death foreshadowed in the open grave. The
classic method of rendering natural background to
human tragedy is rather to adjust the mood of
Nature to the subject in hand; to depict natural
forces either as warring (as in Turner) in the blind
anger and fury of the elements against man, or
assuming an aspect in harmony with his own
pain. But the romantic method finds more
tragedy in the ironic beauty and indifference of
Nature in the face of human vicissitude, and
comes nearer to tears than the affectation of
dramatic sympathy; just as, in great crises of
suffering and doubt, no anger wounds us so deeply
as a smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of this special phase of nature-feeling, a later
artist, of strong affinity of spirit with certain undercurrents
of Pre-Raphaelite thought—Frederick
Walker—is perhaps a greater exponent. But the
old-world Nature-worship, independent of human
interest and moral significance, is as dead in art as
it is in science. Unconsciously perhaps, but
surely, art in all its forms has cast off the yoke of
the old cosmogony which the implacable Time-Spirit
has overthrown. The criticism of life has
passed from the self-satisfied, the confident, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>epicurean, to the reflective, the questioning, and
the experimental stage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where, then, is the secret of the changed attitude
of English culture towards the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood? What was it that was actually
accomplished by this little band of young reformers
with their visions of a world of beauty and meaning
undreamed of in Royal Academy philosophy?
The controversy that raged for years round the
work of the leaders—least of all round that of
Millais, more round that of Holman Hunt, and
most bitterly round the work of Rossetti—was it
primarily over a technical question, a matter of
pigments and perspective, of anatomy and composition?
If so, the house was divided against itself
and should have fallen, for Millais soon forsook (if
indeed he ever adopted) the path of his early
comrades, and a total divergence in method and
manner finally separated Rossetti from Holman
Hunt. Or was it concerned with underlying
principles and purposes with which English culture
had not for three hundred years been troubled?
Was it essentially an ethical revolt; the first
impulse towards that fusion of ethics with æsthetics
which will be the task of the twentieth century;
the inmost stirring, at the nation’s heart, of a new
life which the intellect still fails to lay hold of, and
the laggard will, for the most part, yet resists?</p>

<p class='c005'>Into this atmosphere of revolt and aspiration,
charged as with electric forces of long-gathering
change, a little band of young painters
and poets came, when the time was ripe, to play
their part in the great <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Aufklärung</em></span> of the century.
Students they were in more than the conventional
significance of the word; men of widely different
endowments, and of the most diverse mental
quality, but sensitive at all points to the drift of
thought beneath the surface of the life around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>them. Their task it was to translate into art the
message already proclaimed in poetry, and to
make, even of the poetic vehicle, a finer and more
exquisite setting for the new evangel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The greatest poet of their company, if not in a
literal sense the greatest painter also, was born
within a year of Blake’s death,—on the 12th of
May, 1828, at 38, Charlotte Street, Portland Place,
London: the successor of Blake in English
romance, yet an alien in the land of his birth.
Rossetti suffered, as M. Gabrièl Sarrazin has aptly
expressed it, a double banishment; remote alike
from his country and his age. Essentially Italian
by heritage and temperament, he belonged no less
to the fifteenth century than to Tuscany, and bore
about with him, though perhaps unconsciously, the
burden of the exile as well as of the reformer and
the pioneer. He was as one born out of due
time; or rather, let us say, reborn; a spirit anew-incarnate
from the golden age; brought back,
indeed, from a still earlier re-birth, so that men
almost deemed, as they saw his work and dimly
understood its purport, that one of the prophets
was risen from the dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beyond his inheritance from the far-off past,
from the dormant but undying influences of the
Italian Renaissance, Rossetti held from his immediate
ancestry no mean estate of talent and of
character. His mother, half Tuscan and half
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>English (on her mother’s side), was sister to the
“Dr. Polidori” known to history as Byron’s
travelling companion and friend. These were the
children of Gaetano Polidori, an accomplished and
successful <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>littérateur</em></span>. Gabriele Rossetti, the father
of Dante Gabriel, was wholly Italian, of Neapolitan
family. He also was a man of high literary
tastes and achievements; a poet of genuine
quality, and a patriot exiled for his political faith.
His popular lays, as well as his personal activities,
fanned the flame of democratic insurrection under
Ferdinand of Naples in 1820, and three years later
he found himself compelled to flee in disguise.
He left Italy, never to return; but, happily, not
without honour in his own country, for, a quarter
of a century later, a medal was struck in recognition
of his services, and a statue subsequently erected
to his memory in the chief piazza of Vasto, Naples,
which also bears his name. In 1824 Gabriele
Rossetti settled in England. He married in 1826,
and was shortly appointed professor of Italian at
King’s College, London; in which adopted city—the
great foster-mother of so much of the world’s
best genius—his four children, Dante Gabriel and
his brother and sisters, were brought up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Trained from the first in the Protestant faith,
though inheriting on both sides the mental bias of
Roman tradition, the children entered early into
the age-long conflict between the tender mysticism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>and spiritual glamour of catholic piety and the
robuster spirit of intellectual truth. Herein lay
the key to that strange mingling of rationalism
and superstition which, both in his poetry and in
his painting, has perplexed many critics of Dante
Rossetti’s philosophy. Hence came his insatiable
symbolism, and his acutely realistic detail; his
remoteness of vision, and his keen alertness to
present and actual things. His own perpetual
struggle between the real and the ideal, his ceaseless
strivings to reconcile the inward spirit with
the outward sense,—or rather, to set them in their
right relations to each other, the sense as the
instrument and vehicle of the soul,—these were
but the epitome, in his own many-sided nature, of
the larger strife that ceases not from age to age;
only the battle-ground and the weapons of the
fight are altered.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the simple Christian creed which they
professed, was added in the Rossettis’ household
the religion of an ardent and unwavering patriotism.
From their earliest childhood the little ones were
accustomed to hear around their own fireside high
talks of national liberty and the popular cause.
Their home, unpretentious but hospitable as it
always was, became the resort of many a political
refugee; a gathering-place for kindred souls
oppressed with the same misfortunes, or fired with
the supreme enthusiasm of a common ideal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Hither came Mazzini, the greatest patriot of the
century, and one of her truest seers. All that was
best in the young democracy of the mid-century,
its eager idealism, its narrow but profound hero-worship,
its <a id='corr22'></a><ins class='correction' title='poety'>poetry</ins>, its self-devotion, was here
brought before the children’s eyes; its coarser
elements eliminated by the personal distinction of
such men as Gabriele Rossetti loved to gather to
his side. The little circle was thus open, in those
crucial years, to influences more potent upon art
than was then apparent, since the humanitarian
impulse first manifested in political and social life
had not yet adjusted itself to pictorial expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor was the literary side of Dante Rossetti’s
genius less sympathetically nurtured in the home
atmosphere. His father was an enthusiastic
student and commentator of Dante, after whom he
named his eldest son,—a baptism strangely prophetic
of his destiny; of that fortuity of fate by
which, in after years, bereft of love, maligned by
criticism, robbed of health and power, he was made
partaker in the sufferings as well as in the glory of
the great Florentine poet. Thus was fostered in
the young Dante of a later day that love of old
romance and noble allegory which remained both
with him and with his younger sister—perhaps the
choicest of our women-poets—as an abiding passion
and an inspiration to the highest artistic service.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the age of fifteen Rossetti passed from King’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>College School to Cary’s Art Academy in Queen
Street, Bloomsbury, and thence to the Antique
School of the Royal Academy; there to pursue
the artistic training to which a strong inclination
and evident talent had long called him. Rossetti,
however, was a very wayward pupil, and extremely
irregular in his attendance. A fellow-student
with him at that time, Mr. J.A. Vinter, well
recalls one morning when the truant was taken to
task for his absence on the previous day. “Why,”
said Mr. Cary, “were you not here yesterday?”
Rossetti answered coolly, “I had a fit of idleness.”
But when the master’s back was turned, an interesting
explanation of the avowed idleness was soon
forthcoming. Rossetti pulled from his pocket a
bundle of manuscript sonnets, which he proceeded,
with impartial generosity, to paste inside all his
friends’ hats! Fortunately for the subsequent
peace of the hyper-sensitive and fastidious author,
none of these early effusions seem to have been
preserved. Mr. Vinter’s impression of Rossetti
was—like that of many who knew him in youth—that
beneath a certain brusquerie and unapproachableness
of bearing there lay an unbounded warmth
of affection and a ready generosity and kindliness
of heart. But his delight in practical jokes, his
high spirits and his boisterous hilarity in the classroom
sometimes put Mr. Cary (the son, by the
way, of the eminent translator of Dante) to considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>embarrassment. There was one song in
particular which Rossetti was never tired of singing;
and he sang it with all the vigour of his strong
young voice, almost to the nauseation of his classmates,—in
praise of a certain “Alice Gray.” One
morning Mr. Cary, entering the room, besought
him to abate his tune awhile, for a clergyman had
called with his son to see the school, with a view
to enrolling the lad as a pupil. Rossetti lowered
his voice, but only for a moment. When the
visitors appeared on the threshold, his thrilling
notes were heard again in passionate protestation
of his willingness to die for “Alice Gray.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The school was visited on Saturdays by Mr.
Redgrave, R.A., who speedily observed Rossetti’s
favourite amusement of drawing grotesque caricatures
of antique figures round the margin of his
board, and protested that “such liberties were
hardly consistent with the dignity of the antique.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Rossetti’s outlining is said to have been very
beautiful in effect, though produced in a highly
unconventional manner. Mr. Cary forbade charcoal
outlines altogether, but Rossetti, who obeyed
no rules, invariably made a thick, solid charcoal
line which he gradually pared away on either side
with pellets of bread till he had reduced it to the
desired minimum. It is noticeable that one at
least of Rossetti’s friends of this period, and
intimately associated with him in the movement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>which he subsequently led, has always retained the
hardness of outline which Rossetti afterwards outgrew.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet it must be admitted that with all his ardour,
his real though very fitful diligence, and his sincere
delight in his chosen profession, Rossetti never
fully conquered that imperfection of technique in
draughtsmanship which has been the stronghold
of hostile criticism throughout the Pre-Raphaelite
movement, but which in fact arose from the inevitable
deficiency of a mind too impatient for
ideas, too eager for subject-matter, to be steadfastly
concerned with the science of expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>That neither Rossetti nor any other of the Pre-Raphaelites
<em>as such</em> have attained to technical
greatness, still less to technical perfection, is a
charge weightily preferred, and not without reason,
but hardly of so fatal an import as at first
appears. It must be remembered that no new
message comes to the world ready-clothed in the
full grace of accurate and harmonious speech.
The voice crying in the wilderness is apt to be
harsh and unmusical. The visions of the seer are
at first too vivid, too bewildering in the fresh
glory of revelation, to be told (if he would set
them forth on canvas) in any but broken lights
and shadowy images. In every art, the gospel of
a new epoch has been proclaimed with faltering
speech and stammering tongue. The torrent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>denunciation outpoured on Wagner’s transgressions
of strict form, yet powerless, as it has
proved, to drown his music, was not more sweeping
than the judgment of authority against the
metrical solecisms of Walt Whitman’s poetry;
nor has the storm still raging round the modern
Scandinavian drama been less fierce than that
which overtook the leaders of the Pre-Raphaelite
van.</p>

<p class='c000'>Obviously a certain measure of the faculty of
expression is necessary if the meaning is to be
intelligible at all. Our judgment of an artist,
though determined primarily by the nature of his
message, must ultimately rest on his ability to
deliver it. In Rossetti’s case it must depend upon
the degree in which the greatness of his material
can create a technique of its own, and take the
imagination by storm, as Rossetti does, with those
exquisite surprises of design, those marvellous
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tours-de-force</em></span> among his earlier pen and ink
drawings, or those southern, almost tropical colour-triumphs
of his maturity, which were perhaps
rather the divine accidents of genius than its
habit, either natural or acquired. They were, in
truth, inspirations of utterance, wielding the imperfect
instrument to their own high purposes.
The verdict given upon such achievements by the
thoughtful world outside the charmed circle of
the initiate—by that unlearned but not unworthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“outer circle,” as it were, who, approaching art
with intelligence and sympathy, are yet without
the knowledge to assess its technical worth—will
always, as we have already suggested, be decided
by the temperament of the spectator—whether he
be as peculiarly sensitive to beauty of idea as his
neighbour is to beauty of expression. And after
all, the supreme mission of art is to the great
world of the <em>un</em>initiate. By the authority of its
priests and prophets must its form and practice be
directed and controlled; but the final test of its
greatness is not satisfied until the exquisite consolations
of beauty, the moral significances of
artistic truth, the proclamation of noble ideals, are
“understanded of the people.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the new gospel, when Rossetti entered the
Academy Schools, had only reached the initial
stage of a “gospel of discontent.” It was still
negative, indefinite, unpromising. Yet even in
that early phase, the old, simple instincts of the
missionary spirit are often potent, and fruitful in
the development of ideas. “Andrew ... first
findeth his own brother Simon,” and “Philip
findeth Nathaniel,”—not designedly, perhaps, but
rather by the spontaneous attraction of kindred
souls; not necessarily with the deliberate aim of
a propagandist, for it would be pretentious to
credit a group of nineteenth-century young
Britons in their teens with a very exalted conception
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>of their artistic mission. There is every
evidence that they were as unaffectedly boyish,
and even school-boyish, as the most orthodox
Englishman could wish them. It was well that
they should not yet know the meaning of their
own rebellion, or guess the effect to be wrought
upon English art by Rossetti’s meeting with the
first fellow-student who can in any sense be called
his disciple. Probably it was an impulse of purely
personal affection, or that magnetic charm of
character which Rossetti exercised over almost all
impressionable natures around him, rather than
any deep affinity of purpose and ideal, that won to
his side a younger and in many respects more
brilliant aspirant, John Everett Millais, who had
passed through his two years’ elementary training
at Cary’s at a very early age, and in technical
proficiency was already far ahead of his new
friend. Born on the 8th of June, 1829, in Portland
Place, Southampton, the first five years of
his life were chiefly spent in Jersey (his father’s
ancestral home), and the succeeding four at Dinan,
in Brittany. In 1838, at the age of nine, he was
entered at Cary’s Academy, then under the direction
of Mr. Sass, where his drawing from the
antique soon won a silver medal from the Society
of Arts. In 1840, at the age of eleven, he entered
the Royal Academy Schools; the youngest pupil
ever admitted within their walls. Here he won a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>silver medal in 1843, and four years later a gold
medal for historical painting with “The Benjamites
Seizing their Brides,” shown at the British
Institution in 1848. In 1846 his first exhibited
picture, “Pizarro before the Inca of Peru,” appeared
at the Royal Academy, where “Elgiva
Seized by Odo” was shown in 1847.</p>

<p class='c000'>Millais himself, meanwhile, had made acquaintance
with an older and still more earnest student
not yet pursuing the Academy curriculum, but
for whom the future had in store a place second
only to Rossetti’s in the movement which united
and inspired them in their youth. William
Holman Hunt, indeed, may claim to have been
earlier than any of his Pre-Raphaelite brethren
upon the field of reform; for in the hard solitude
of mercantile life, under the stress of poverty and
amid the most uncongenial surroundings, he had
already thought out and pursued those methods
of direct and veracious artistic expression which
were afterwards enforced by Pre-Raphaelite rule.
Born in London on the 27th of April, 1828, and
destined by his father for commercial life, the lad
secured from chance companions some occasional
help in the artistic studies which he loved. He
took a few lessons from a city portrait-painter,
and at last gave up his business career, and threw
himself upon his own artistic resources for a
livelihood.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Admission to the schools of the Royal Academy
at that time was by a test as arbitrary and inadequate
as the teaching to which it led. Each
student was required to produce a drawing from
the antique, in chalk or charcoal, laboriously
stippled in the conventional style; and in this
task the half-trained and inexperienced Hunt
very pardonably failed on two successive occasions.
It was not until the year 1846 that he was
at last admitted as a student, and at almost the
same time secured a place on the Academy Exhibition
walls, where he was represented by a
small picture entitled “Hark!”—a little child
holding a watch to her ear. It was in the antique
galleries at the British Museum, while toiling
forlornly at his trial-drawing among a host of
similar candidates, that he came across the more
successful but sympathetic and genial Millais.
The story of <a id='corr30'></a><ins class='correction' title='Millias’s'>Millais’s</ins> friendship with the poor
and struggling student somewhat older than himself,
and of the generous pecuniary help afforded
from his own private resources to Hunt at a
moment when the magic portals of Art seemed
closed for ever against him, has already been told
by Mr. Harry Quilter in his history of those early
years.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the autumn of 1845 Mr. Cary sent up five
students, including Rossetti and J.A. Vinter, for
admission to the Academy Schools. His classes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>were held in high esteem as a means of introduction
to that orthodox fold, already regarded by
many neophytes with impatience and distrust, but
offering at that time the only possible entrance to
professional life. Both the competitors just mentioned
were successful, and the admission of
Holman Hunt was independently gained soon
afterwards. Mr. Vinter has a characteristic reminiscence
of the opening day of the ensuing term,
when the freshmen were assembled in a class-room,
and required to give their names to the keeper,
Mr. Jones. When it came to his turn, Rossetti,
who was rather proud of his mellifluous designation,
greatly amused his companions and impressed
the venerable official by slowly rolling out, in his
rich, sonorous tones, “Gabriel—Charles—Dante—Rossetti!”
“Dear me, sir,” stammered Mr.
Jones, in confused amazement, “Dear me, sir, you
<em>have</em> a fine name!”</p>

<p class='c000'>A probation of three months was necessary,
however, before the candidates were finally accepted
as students in the Royal Academy Schools.
It is doubtful whether Rossetti ever finished his
probationary drawings: at all events he never
entered the Life School, and does not appear to
have passed beyond the elementary stages of the
Antique. But whatever may have been the deficiencies
of their early training in art, a result of
ample significance was now realized by the intercourse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>which united in close friendship the illustrious
trio—Rossetti, Millais, and Holman Hunt—who
were shortly to be recognized as the prime
movers in the Pre-Raphaelite revolt.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was yet, however, another reformer at
work, unknown to them, upon the same problems
as perplexed themselves, stirred with the same
restless discontent with the vain canons of conventional
art, and pursuing, in his own obscure
studio, methods which came upon the younger
trio as the revelation that they needed. Ford
Madox Brown, with whom they now became
acquainted, was seven years older than Dante
Rossetti, having been born at Calais, of English
parents, on the 16th of April, 1821. He studied
first under Van Hanselaer at Ghent, and afterwards
spent two years under Baron Wappers at
the Antwerp Academy (1837–1839), three in Paris,
(1841–1844), and one in Rome (1845). In his
twentieth year he married his cousin, Miss Elizabeth
Bromley, who died in 1846. His experiences
of the foreign schools seem to have kindled in him
the same dissatisfaction with current standards of
perfection as was gaining ground among his contemporaries
at home. At all events, when Rossetti
was vaguely casting about for kindred spirits
aflame with revolutionary fire, Madox Brown was
the poor and unknown painter of a few decorative
cartoons exhibited during the eighteen-forties in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Westminster Hall, for a competition organized by
the government with a view to selecting the best
available fresco-work for the ornamentation of the
new House of Lords. The competition was carried
over several years, and served in a great measure
to define and organize the growing revolt against
the tyranny of the Academy, under which, as early
as the year 1840, the younger generation of painters
was already beginning to writhe. The leading
Academicians of that time were men whose names,
as far as the outer world is concerned, have
scarcely outlived their owners. Etty, Mulready,
Maclise, Leslie, Herbert, Chalon, Cooper, Collins,
Eastlake, Howard, Hart, Jones, Unwins, Patten,
Charles Landseer, Redgrave, Shee,—who knows
them now beyond the student and the connoisseur?
Webster, indeed, has earned a more enduring
fame, and gained a secure if unpretentious rank in
the portrayal of village life, fairly comparable to
that of Mrs. Gaskell in fiction. But for the rest,
even the few gifted and sincere aspirants outside
the Academy, but still in the thrall of conventional
methods, such as Cope, Dyce, Ward, Egg, Elmore,
Goodall, Pickersgill, Hook, Poole, Stone, Martin,
Haydon, and David Scott, were but a heterogeneous
group, without clear aims or common aspirations.
The Westminster competition attracted and developed
new talent from independent quarters. It
was the first deliberate effort of English art to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>shake itself free from academic control. Its effect
was to revive, for the time being, a decorative
method noble in itself, but still more valuable as a
training in breadth and dignity of expression, especially
for the young artist to whom the fresco
was practically a foreign language, full of latent
possibility and charm. Practice in fresco-work
had a directly good effect on the technique of new
and unknown men at the precise stage of their
studies at which it was afforded them. Madox
Brown’s style in particular was strongly and permanently
influenced by such exercise, and the
competitions evoked from him a series of historical
and dramatic <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>genre</em></span> paintings which won
Rossetti’s special admiration. Chief among them
were “The Body of Harold brought before William
the Conqueror,” which still ranks with the artist’s
finest productions of its kind, “Justice,” a widow
pleading before a Norman baron, “Adam and Eve
after the Fall,” “Wiclif reading his Translation of
the Bible to John of Gaunt,” “Our Lady of Good
Children,” and “The Infant’s Repast.” One fine
cartoon from the hand of another artist also drew
Rossetti’s delighted attention, “Caractacus led
Captive in Triumph through the Streets of Rome,”
by G.F. Watts, a painter worthily representative
of the noblest phase of Pre-Raphaelite work, though
never openly associated with the movement. He
too had vainly traversed the desert of academic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>studentship, as we may gather from his own naïve
record: “Finding there was no teaching, I very
soon ceased to attend.” His picture of “Caractacus,”
however, was now rewarded with a first-class
prize of £300. Millais also competed in the
exhibition of 1847; taking for his subject “The
Widow bestowing her Mite.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the spring of 1848, Rossetti, deeply impressed
by the originality and power of Madox Brown’s
designs, wrote to the artist and begged permission
to enter his studio as a pupil. Mr. Brown did not
receive pupils professionally, but, with a generosity
which he showed to many an eager votary at that
period, he welcomed Rossetti to his studio as a
friend, and from that time became one of his
kindest and most valued counsellors.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the date of Rossetti’s self-introduction to
Madox Brown, the latter was engaged upon a
somewhat elaborate picture, “Chaucer reading the
Legend of Custance before the Court of Edward
III.”; and Rossetti was invited to sit to him for
the head of the poet. Hunt and Rossetti were
now working together in a studio which they
shared in Cleveland Street, Fitzroy Square;
whither soon came Madox Brown to encourage
their tentative efforts, and to aid them both with
practical and friendly instruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now a new influence from the world of
literature came upon the little student-band. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>was the inspiration and stimulus of Ruskin’s
“Modern Painters.” For Ruskin also was at war
with the old conventions that lay chill and heavy
upon English art; he too was weary of the dead
level of triviality and scholasticism to which painting
had sunk, and saw with prophetic eyes, through
the murk of present life and the shadowy vistas of
history, a higher and attainable ideal.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Modern Painters” struck the keynote of the
coming change. A fellow-student lent the volumes
to Holman Hunt, who in his turn shared them
with his friends; and reading together, they found
therein, not only a sympathy for their own revolt,
but a definite guidance for their aspirations. With
the authority of the trained draughtsman and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>connoisseur</em></span>
as well as with the force and fascination
of the literary artist, Ruskin declared for originality
and truth in design, as against the imitations and
artifices of degenerate schools, in a voice that
would brook no compromise. Like Carlyle, his
whole being was possest with that passionate
scorn of pretensions and shams, that hatred of
formalism and of every species of cant, which
swept like a cleansing wind over Europe after the
French Revolution, and which, if its immediate
results were iconoclastic and disruptive, was so
much the better preparation for the reconstruction
to follow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ruskin bade men turn, from the Art of the past,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>to Nature, and seek fresh inspiration at its primal
source. Through Nature alone, he said, they would
reach truth, and finding it, gain also the power to
interpret and reveal. And Nature was a jealous
mistress; only to a faithful lover would she unveil
the exquisite mysteries of her beauty; unto his
ear alone would she whisper the high secrets of
her soul; she would endure no translator, no
partial and distorted reflection of her face: the
man himself must worship at her inmost shrine,
and learn her lesson there direct and clear.</p>

<p class='c000'>—A truism, it seems to us, who have seen the
swinging of the pendulum still further in the
naturalistic direction, since the reaction in divers
quarters against convention and precedent has
carried many to the opposite extreme. Yet, in
the history of the world, the demand for precedent
and conformity, the love of imitation, the morbid
hatred of novelty and the dread of original experiment,
which appear in almost every crisis of man’s
development, exhibit one of the most curious
phases of the human mind. Psychologists might
argue at length as to the relation between indolence
and cowardice in the strange game of “follow-my-leader”
played by humanity from age to age,—and
might attribute both to a vague and deep
sense of the bitter cost of all knowledge, and a
consequent and not wholly vain tenacity towards
things apparently knowable and known.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Ruskin, with a vision large enough to retain all
that was eternally precious in the past, began by
recognizing the elements of real vitality even in
the outworn classicism which was the occasion of
his readers’ revolt; and led them thence to the
higher places of refreshment and advance. “We
must be careful,” said he, “not to lose sight of the
real use of what has been left us by antiquity, nor
to take that for a model of perfection which is, in
many cases, only a guide to it. The young artist,
while he should shrink with horror from the iconoclast
who would tear from him every landmark
and light which has been bequeathed him by
the ancients, and leave him in a liberated childhood,
may be equally certain of being betrayed
by those who would give him the power and the
knowledge of past time, and then fetter his strength
from all advance, and bend his eyes backward on
a beaten path; who would thrust canvas between
him and the sky, and tradition between him and
God.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, Ruskin insisted continually upon the
essential and supreme moral purpose of art as a
“criticism of life”—as a later authority has called it.
He made clear the relation between <em>thought</em> and
<em>language</em> in painting, wherein lies for ever the
crux of art; and pointed to examples of the
contrast and the conflict between those two principles
whereof the right adjustment is art’s final
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>aim. “Most pictures,” said Ruskin, “of the
Dutch school, for instance, excepting always those
of Rubens, Vandyke, and Rembrandt, are ostentatious
exhibitions of the artist’s power of speech,
the clear and vigorous elocution of useless and
senseless words; while the early efforts of Cimabue
and Giotto are the burning messages of prophecy,
delivered by the stammering lips of infants. It
must be the part of the judicious critic carefully to
distinguish what is language and what is thought,
and to rank and praise pictures chiefly for the
latter, considering the former as a totally inferior
excellence, and one which cannot be compared
with, nor weighed against thought in any way
or in any degree whatsoever. The picture which
has the nobler and more numerous ideas, however
awkwardly expressed, is a greater and a better
picture than that which has the less noble and less
numerous ideas, however beautifully expressed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus the author of “Modern Painters” did for
his readers what was more helpful than all precept,—he
showed them the high paths trodden aforetime
by men of like aspirations after a similar
revolt. He led them back to an age which had
seen the same struggle between the old art and the
new; an age in which the difficulty of presenting
human life and its environment in faithful colours
and in natural images had already been met, and
in some measure overcome. That age was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>mother of modern art in Europe. The fourteenth
century, waking from mediævalism, felt the first
quickenings of the Renaissance in Italy.</p>

<p class='c000'>To that momentous impulse of new life wherein
lay, deep-rooted in the laws of reaction and
development, the destinies of modern Europe, the
historian of the Pre-Raphaelite movement must
turn if he would read aright the motive and the
message of to-day. For the impulse sought in the
records of the past by the reformers of a later age
was of a spirit kindred with their own, though
grappling with its problems under a somewhat
different guise. It was a revolt, not from materialism
as we commonly understand it, namely, the
acceptance of matter as the sole and ultimate
reality, and a tacit or open disavowal of the spiritual
life; but rather from that more subtle and
insidious form of materialism so often mistaken
for its opposite—the asceticism of mediæval Christianity.
To deny the dignity and sanctity of the
physical as the garment of the spiritual world is
surely as blank a materialism as that which makes
the physical sufficient and supreme. To see no
spirit in the flesh is to be no less blind than they
who see no spirit <em>beyond</em> the flesh. The innate
cynicism of the monastic idea—its radical <em>faith</em>lessness,
its utter distrust of the Spirit’s power to
transfigure and ennoble the noble life of man—is
sufficiently evidenced by the fact that the results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>of that idea upon the art of the nation were almost
identical with the results wrought upon England
by the materialism of the eighteenth century.
Art became a fashion instead of a mission, a cult
instead of a worship; it became the prerogative of
a ruling class which conventionalized—as such
must ever do—the spontaneous utterance of the
many into the vain repetitions of the few. That
class in modern England was the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>bourgeoisie</em></span>: in
mediæval Italy it was the priesthood. Herein
arose the narrow religiosity of the early Italian
painters, no less than the ascetic barrenness of the
dark ages which preceded them. Art had been
subsidized by a ruling class, however beneficent,
for its own purposes, however sincere and high.
The gradual establishment of Christianity as the
state religion of the later Roman period involved
the repudiation—or at least the effort to repudiate—the
whole intellectual or æsthetic heritage of the
Græco-Roman world.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a curious pathos in the attempt of
every vigorous outgrowth of human endeavour to
disown the prior activity which gave it birth.
The ancient fable of the chick and the egg-shell is
of perennial meaning and pertinence. Militant
Christianity marched forward wholly unconscious
of its own vast debt to the very paganism upon
which it thrust itself in holy war. The novel
fervour of asceticism had extinguished science
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>before the end of the third century, art in the sixth
and seventh, and the Greek language by the ninth.
But the transition of Italy from paganism to Christianity
was not a substitution of wholly new ideals
for old. It was the gradual absorption of all
the permanent elements in pagan culture into
a religion of which the germ only was brought
from the Hebrew world, and which owed most of
its strength and much of its weakness to the rich
and heterogeneous soil in which it was planted.
The extravagances of mediæval Christianity—its
austere intolerance and contempt of the natural
and obvious, its demand, in the first strenuous
tension of novelty and triumph, for the subjective
and the transcendental life—breaking up, when
the strain was relaxed, into a hard formalism of
thought and practice—these were but the inevitable
reaction from the grossness of a degenerate
paganism whose vital force was spent. The
immense lapse of time occupied by the transition
from paganism to Christianity, as Mr. Bernard
Bosanquet ably points out in dealing with the
issues of that change, gave room for as many
secondary waves of action and reaction within
itself as did the movement of the Renaissance
which succeeded it. “From the first distinct
breach in naïve or natural paganism to the assumption
of a definitely doctrinal and orthodox form of
Christianity, there is an interval which cannot be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>reckoned at less than seven hundred years, from
the death of Socrates to the triumph of Christianity
under Constantine. So far from being a new thing,
contrasting with the degradation of the pagan
world, the establishment of Christianity was the
issue of the advance of that world during four
centuries, and it was not thoroughly completed
until, in a further development of five centuries, it
had adopted from paganism the germs of almost
all permanently valuable elements that the latter
contained.... The Dark Ages are not a proof
that the great classical culture had lost its power
for human welfare; they prove only how long a
discipline was needed by the mass of humanity
before it could appreciate more than the first stammering
misapprehension of its great inheritance.”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The dawn, then, of the Renaissance in Italy,
was the waking of the mediæval world to the
sense of this lost inheritance, yet to be regained;
this hidden dower of beauty and gladness, and of
strong and abundant life. The old message of the
Galilean Christ had to be re-translated, as it has
to-day: “I am come that they might have life,
and that they might have it more abundantly,”—not
a one-sided life, not a spiritual life at the cost
of the body, any more than a bodily life at the cost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>of the soul, but a life robust, many-sided, catholic;
harmonized at all points with what is good and
sweet and fair in the physical world as well as
what is high and pure and noble in the life within.
And that message led men back to the great first
principles of conduct and consciousness, till they
were confronted afresh with the want of equipoise
between physical instinct and moral law which is
the root-problem of human history. The struggle
for <em>existence</em> in the animal world rises in humanity
from a physical to a moral sphere, and passes into
a struggle for <em>life</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>“History,” says Buckle, “is a record of tendencies,
not of events.” The first tendency of
the people thus waking, as we have said, to the
sense of their own birthright and heritage, partook
rather of the first of these two impulses. It was
a revolt against the spiritual exclusiveness of the
monastic ideal, and a recoil upon Nature,—especially
upon the apotheosis and worship of Nature already
achieved for them in the Hellenic world. The
imperious demands of the physical life, so long
starved and neglected, drove men back upon external
things; slowly to re-discover, through outward
and visible realities, the deeper meanings of
which they were in search. The end of the twelfth
and the beginning of the thirteenth century saw a
new turn of the current of feeling towards liberty
and expansion of the whole life of man. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>painters set themselves to humanize religion; to
bring it into relation with the vital interests of the
so-called secular sphere. And as the fine arts
became emancipated from sacerdotal control, the
spirit of free culture spread into other departments
of intellectual activity. In the next century, the
revival of learning followed upon the emancipation
of art. Literature, religion, painting and sculpture,
were infused with the same spirit of experiment
and research. Art was brought into touch with
scholarship, and scholarship in its turn graced and
dignified by art. The essence of romance lies in
its utter fidelity to immediate and present life. Its
concern is with particular instances, not with abstractions
and generalities. Romance is primarily
analytic and experimental; classicism, synthetic
and positive. Romance is inductive, classicism
deductive in its reasoning. Herein romance—deemed
for the most part antagonistic to reason
and science, approaches more nearly to the scientific
spirit than any canons of classic art. Its root
and base is in that patient observation of actual
things, that sure simplicity and directness of vision,
which is the narrow way to knowledge. Hence
comes the realism of romance,—the realism both
of the early Renaissance and of its later maturity.
A dominant characteristic (for instance) of Michaelangelo—the
greatest and most fascinating personality
of the whole Renaissance period—was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>as his latest biographer, Mr. John Addington
Symonds, has pointed out, that “he invariably
preferred the particular to the universal, the critical
moment of an action to suggestions of the
possibilities of action.” This feature of the highest
Renaissance work, though it seem at first sight to
disprove the general theory of romance as the
meditative, contrasted with the classic or dramatic
form of art, is really consonant with it, since one
example of one action is more analytic and reflective
in quality than the suggestion of action
generally. Our assertion, then, that the first
manifestation of the break-up of the monastic
system was a return to Nature as revealed and
worshipped in the Hellenic ideal, must be qualified
by a recognition of another tendency modifying
and chastening the first.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second tendency was towards the reconciliation
of the superb naturalism of Grecian art with
the Christian spirit of self-discipline and heroic
denial. It was an effort after that ultimate balance
and harmony prophesied (to bring a modern
instance) in Ibsen’s “Third Kingdom;” the kingdom
in which the realism of the flesh and the
idealism of the spirit shall be blended into one
perfect humanity. “It was a movement,” to quote
again from Mr. J.A. Symonds, “towards that further
point outside both Paganism and mediæval
Christianity, at which the classical ideal of a temperate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and joyous natural life shall be restored to
the conscience educated by the gospel.” The
vision of this union was the inspiration of Pre-Raphaelite
art. It quickened the hands of the
painters to great tasks; it stirred the scholars to a
new energy of labour and of hope. The poets,
interpreting its meaning for the life of a future
Italy, began to speak one to another across the
mediæval gloom, as waking birds call and answer,
while it is yet dark, with a sure instinct prophetic
of the dawn.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus the unruffled calm and dignity of Hellenism
was troubled, in its re-birth, with a sense of
moral conflict and perplexity unknown to the
ancient world. A peculiar mysticism resulted
upon literature from that revival of the Platonic
spirit which was initiated by Pico della Mirandola
and his successors in metaphysical thought.
Throughout the Pre-Raphaelite epoch, from Cimabue
(124O) to Perugino, the master of Raphael
(1446), the impulse of naturalism is seen adjusting
itself, through much crudeness of expression,
through many blunders, solecisms of taste, errors
of selection, to the great spiritual passion of
Christianity which was still warm at the heart of
the thinking world. There is, especially in early
Renaissance work, an effect as of divided aims, or
of methods long habituated to the old ideal and
brought suddenly into the service of the new,—like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Heine’s “decayed gods, who, to maintain
themselves after the fall of paganism, took employment
under the new religion.” The physical
loveliness of the saints and angels of Botticelli and
Fra Angelico—the last of the purely “religious”
painters, in the common acceptance of the word—is
hardly congruous with the loftiness of their
themes, and almost belies the spiritual intensity
and rapture of thought which Botticelli, in later
life, drew largely from the influence of Savonarola,
and infused increasingly into his own work.
Giotto, the pride of the Florentine school and the
dominant genius of the fourteenth century, was no
less profoundly religious than these; but in the
final roll of art he ranks rather as the first great
<em>Nature</em>-painter than as one of a distinctly Christian
lineage. Taken, like David, from the sheepfold,
he brought into art a breezy, pastoral air, and
painted before a wide horizon under an open sky.
Fra Lippo Lippi added to that wholesome strength
and sanity of sight an even clearer perception of
natural beauty and grace. The glories of the
physical realm, in landscape, in the power of men
and in the loveliness of women, were handled now
with a growing boldness which outran the delicate
timidity that had restrained it in the shadow of the
Church. And with the enlargement of intellectual
range there came a steady increase of technical
power. The skill of choice, of selectiveness in art,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>of composition, draughtsmanship, colouring,—in a
word, the science of <em>expression</em>, was brought to
bear upon the ready message waiting for the perfecting
of its vehicles. The adaptation of language
to thought, which was the task of the fifteenth
century, was achieved by the immediate predecessors
of Raphael in a measure unequalled in
the history of the modern world. And that such
an adjustment should resolve itself, as it did, into
a fresh conflict between the forces momentarily
reconciled, proves, not that the success of the effort
was spurious, but rather that the struggle between
thought and language in art is but one manifestation
of the eternal striving of the Spirit with the
imperfect medium of the flesh.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this rare consummation of harmony between
the erstwhile conflicting principles of classicism and
romance, though reaching its highest point in Leonardo
and Michaelangelo, achieved in the Venetian
school a technical effect which appealed even more
strongly to the æsthetic passion re-born in Rossetti
and his friends, as they looked back across the ages
in their search for example and light. In Giorgione,
the creator of idyllic <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>genre</em></span> painting in the fourteenth
century, and in Titian, of whom Rossetti
himself was in due course the natural successor,
they found all the mystic sensuousness of the new
Paganism in a setting which, to adapt a well-worn
phrase, revealed instead of concealing the soul
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>within. Here, at least, was the apotheosis of <em>colour</em>,
which is itself a characteristic quality of all romantic
revivals: wherefore painting has always been specifically
the romantic medium in art, while the classic
temper finds in sculpture its most congenial sphere.
Classicism invariably compromises with the tints
of nature; it resolves the ever-varying hues of
earth and sky into the formula of the spectroscope;
it tends, in its purest and noblest phases, towards
marble and the statuesque. Here was the perfection
of artistic language, as Ruskin would call it;
the delight in strong and full utterance for its own
sake, wherein lurks the perennial danger of greatness
in technique. With all its glow and glory of
natural life, the Venetian school was primarily
decorative in character, and therefore merged the
more readily into the gradual substitution of form
for matter, the general deterioration of naturalism
into sensuality, which overtook Italian art after the
decadence of Raphael.</p>

<p class='c000'>Together with the more robust conception of
the physical life which supervened in the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries, there came a
change, partial indeed, but progressive, in the
ideals of womanhood. The Madonnas of Botticelli
were instinct with a warmth and sensitiveness
unknown before in Christian art. If they were
immaculate, their perfectness was that of a God-possest
humanity rather than of a humanized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Godhead. Their faces shine with natural pity
and awe and tenderness and love,—the love of
the true <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Mater Dolorosa</em></span>, sad with</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>“The burden of the mystery,</div>
      <div class='line'>... the heavy and the weary weight</div>
      <div class='line'>Of all this unintelligible world.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>They see the shadow of the Cross upon the holy
Child, and their passionate life quivers before the
Death to be. The same brooding sense of
mystery, the same large and intense compassion
for the “world-sorrow,” yet mingled with a certain
austerity of outlook upon its strife, is the dominant
note of Leonardo’s masterpiece of a later date,
“La Gioconda” (“Our Lady of the Rocks”);
often compared with that triumph of a more
modern Renaissance, Albrecht Dürer’s “Melancholia,”
with which it shares in the attainment of
perfect harmony between classic and romantic art.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the return of art in the fourteenth century
from the angelic to the human world did not go
far enough to affect the ideals of womanhood beyond
this single aspect—the aspect of maternity.
The early Renaissance painters did indeed
humanize, in conception and presentment, the virgins
and the venerable mother-saints of Christendom;
but their imagination never concerned itself
with what may be termed the independent humanity
of womanhood. They painted always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>under the sway of that central and dominant <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>motif</em></span>
of the Christian mythology,—the idea of woman
as the receptive and passive vehicle of the God-man;
and never presented woman as daughter,
sister, lover, or wife, apart from the concurrent
idea of potential motherhood. This limitation—unfortunately
for art—instead of being removed by
a further broadening of thought and vision as the
Renaissance proceeded, was emphasized in the
fifteenth century by the influence of Raphael, who
cultivated and stereotyped his own ideal of the
“for-ever-motherly” until—so subtle is the influence
of fixed types in pictorial art upon the
current standards of truth and beauty—the maternal
function came to be regarded as the sole and
sufficient object of a woman’s existence; and the
conventional Madonna-face of Raphael became a
bondage from which Christianity has taken more
than three centuries to set itself free.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the advent of Raphael into Italian art
marked the beginning of the degradation of the
pure and wholesome naturalism achieved in the
Renaissance into a coarse materialism which in its
turn degenerated into a false and shallow conventionality,
and had an effect infinitely mischievous
upon Italy, still more so upon France, and through
France upon the England of the Stuart and Hanoverian
periods. It might almost be said that the
greatness of Raphael was the weakness of modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>art. The immediate result of a triumph in
technique—of a great success in the wedding of
perfect utterance to noble thought—is sometimes
to produce, in the moral atmosphere around it, a
sense of finality, a relaxing of tension, in which the
soul is overpowered by its own conquest of the
medium, and loses itself in the facile freedom thus
attained. The disciples of Raphael, counting him
to have achieved the highest perfection, modelled
themselves upon his manner, and thence upon his
mannerisms, without question or reserve; just as,
in metaphysics and philosophy, the schoolmen
argued from Aristotle without any reference to the
external world, and, bound in the thrall of his
genius, followed implicitly the narrow trend of his
reasoning, until, entangled in theoretical cobwebs
of their own spinning, they lost altogether the use
of the inductive method, founded upon observation
and experiment, which is the only true basis of
knowledge. Imitation may be the sincerest form
of flattery, but it is sometimes a fatal hindrance to
progress. Its maleficence in the world of mental
science is not greater than the mischief wrought in
art by a spirit which does as much harm to the
work of the copyist as to the reputation of the
model. As Ruskin says, “All that is highest in
art, all that is creative and imaginative, is formed
and created by every great master for himself,
and cannot be repeated or imitated by others.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Raphael at first-hand was always great, often
sublime. Raphael second-hand,—stereotyped, formalized,
degraded by three centuries of imitations,
each more laboured than the last,—became vapid,
artificial, meaningless. The original inspiration
was destroyed. Art lost its hold on Nature; and,
severed from that sole source of power, fell into
inevitable decay.</p>

<p class='c000'>History repeats itself, but with a difference.
Man’s struggle, as we have said, for balance, for
self-adjustment to the forces around him, and to
the greater forces within, recurs in every age of
the world’s life, but under conditions ever new.
The nineteenth century supplied such new conditions
for the old task. The ground that had
long lain fallow was not wasted in its time of
barrenness, but made ready in unfruitful autumns
for fresh seed; prepared by silent and secret
forces for a new harvest. Shaken by social revolution,
roused by the pressure of intellectual problems
on every side, Art was confronted once
more with the great realities of life and death,
good and evil, and turned for guidance to the
witness of the past: as a soul, once quick to action
but long sunk in apathy, awakes again to the
mystery of the ideal, and gathering itself together
for fresh strife, calls urgently upon the old wisdom
and the remembered strength of yore.</p>

<p class='c000'>In such a spirit did Dante Gabriel Rossetti and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>his comrades turn from the dull abstractions of
academic tradition, and lift their eyes towards that
golden age whose dawning answered their own
cry for light. Not to the material and redundant
splendours of Raphaelesque art did they look for
the inspiration of the hour; not to the pseudoclassicism
of the later Renaissance, but to the
pristine freshness and purity of its youth: just as
we now look for the true significance of the
romantic revival, not to the Postlethwaite of
fashionable society, or to the weak sensuality of a
drawing-room æstheticism; not to the latter-day
apotheosis of lust which is but a gross travesty
of the vigorous naturalism of Hellenic and early
Renaissance art, but to the gracious innocence and
seriousness of Rossetti’s “Virgin,” the noble beauty
and pathos of his dying “Beatrice,” and the austere
tenderness of Hunt’s sore-tempted “Isabella,” confronting
Claudio’s painful face with the set resolve
of her impregnable womanhood. So, seeking and
following all that was best in the past, and facing,
with vision clarified by that high discipline, the
intellectual, social, and moral strife of the nineteenth
century, the young painters set themselves “to
disengage,” as Sainte-Beuve says, “the elements
of beauty,” and to put them forth in some sort of
order and lucidity, even if it were but in a tentative
formula, yet to be subjected to the tests of
time.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Revolt from the Raphaelesque—Influence of Keats and the
Romantic Poets—The Pre-Raphaelite Brothers and their
Early Work—Travels of Rossetti with Hunt—Publication

at Liverpool—The Pre-Raphaelites as
Colourists.</p>

<p class='c005'>The impulse thus given by Ruskin, in the
minds of the young painters, towards the
larger spiritual life and vision of the Pre-Raphaelite
period, was strengthened, as Mr. Holman
Hunt has told us, by the almost accidental
sight of a book of engravings from the frescoes in
the Campo Santo at Pisa, which fell into the hands
of Rossetti and his friends while spending an
evening together at Millais’s house. To such aspirants
as they, “crying bitterly unto the gods for
a kingdom wherein to rule and create,” the work
of the early Italian masters here set forth, though
already partially known to them in the National
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Gallery, opened up a new world to be conquered
and explored. In the suggestive rather than
successful achievements of Cimabue, Giotto, Ghiberti,
and Masaccio, they discerned the wealth of
<em>thought</em> to which Ruskin had directed them, though
the <em>language</em> was still in the course of adjustment
to the meaning within. One cannot but think
with a half-amused tenderness of the eager experimentalism
of the young schismatics, shaking off
from their feet the dust of academic propriety, and
wandering back, half in jest, half in earnest, in the
buoyant prowess of their youth, to the free fields
wherefrom</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It is a pleasant picture which rises in the memory,
of the diverse trio, destined in after years for widely
different paths of effort and success, yet welded at
first in the glow of a common enthusiasm of revolt.
It was impossible that they should perceive, at this
early age, that the reaction in which they were
united was but a preparing of the way for an
artistic reconstruction which would demand from
its leaders congruity of ideal as well as community
of protest. The principle of non-conformity may
embrace almost opposite poles of doctrine and
practice, but the positive elements of a faith must
possess alike the minds of its prophets if they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>to pursue in permanent fellowship the goal at which
they aim. As George Eliot has said, “If men are
to be welded together in the glow of a transient
feeling, they must be made of metal that will mix,
else they will inevitably fall asunder when the heat
dies out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But there was as yet a strong practical cohesion
between the grave and gentle Hunt, the brilliant,
warm-hearted, and impressionable Millais, and the
ardent, mercurial, and passionately imaginative
Rossetti, whose personal magnetism was the
immediate welding-force of the Pre-Raphaelite
movement. Rossetti’s proselytizing powers, and
his inexhaustible enthusiasm (at least in youth) for
dogmatic propaganda, were indeed a source of some
embarrassment and many disappointments in the
progress of artistic reform. The doctrine of Pre-Raphaelitism,
however, if we may so call it—namely
that in the age preceding Raphael would
be found the touchstone of art, grew up too imperceptibly
through mutual influences and interchange
of thought to be attributed as a special tenet to
Rossetti or any other of the student-band.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in the year 1847, before the formation of
the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, that the spell of
Keats had come with special power upon its future
leaders. Rossetti, an omnivorous reader of poetry,
had already perceived both in Keats and Coleridge
the essential elements of the highest romance. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>is the more remarkable that Chatterton, now acclaimed
as the herald of the romantic revival in
poetry, as was Blake in art, had no such charm for
Rossetti until quite late in life, when the tardy
discovery led to an exaggerated worship. But in
Keats, whose life (by Lord Houghton) Rossetti,
Holman Hunt, and Millais had been reading together
about this time, they found the supreme
example in English poetry of that attainment of
harmony between the classic and the romantic
temper which was their aim in art. Eager as they
now were for subject-matter whereon to exercise
the artistic principles as yet but crudely formulated
in their minds, they turned with new delight to the
wonder-world revealed to them by the spirit of
Keats, and looked with him through</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>—“magic casements, opening on the foam</div>
      <div class='line'>Of perilous seas in faëry lands forlorn.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>They saw that the reconciliation of the flesh to the
spirit, which is the task of the second Renaissance as
of the first, had already been achieved in poetry, and
was waiting its translation into pictorial art. Keats
had attained that perfect blending of the Greek
spirit with the temper of romance which Rossetti
was to reach in “Venus Astarte” and “Pandora.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The first organized union of workers imbued
with the Pre-Raphaelite ideal, and further knit
together by a common enthusiasm for the poetry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>of Keats, appears to have taken the form of a
cyclographic society, in which the dominant
spirits—Rossetti, Millais, and Holman Hunt—were
soon surrounded by a group of more or less
gifted companions and friends. The members
were pledged to contribute original drawings in
regular succession to a portfolio which was passed
round for criticism by their fellows. Rossetti, who
liked to rule his little kingdom with an absolute
sway, seldom disputed by those who deemed submission
to his imperious ways but a small price to
pay for his friendship, selected from Keats’s “Isabella”
the following series of subjects to exercise
the talents of the society:—1. “The Lovers;” 2.
“The Brothers” (of Isabella); 3.“Good-bye,”
(the parting of Isabella and Lorenzo); 4. “The
Vision” (Isabella sees in a dream the murder of
her lover by her brother); 5. “The Wood”
(Isabella visits the scene of the crime and secretly
bears away the head of her lover); 6. “The Pot
of Basil” (she buries the head in her flower-pot);
7. “The Brothers discover the Pot;” 8. “Madness
of Isabella.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It does not appear that any member executed
this exhaustive series of proposed sketches in its
entirety. The suggestion of subjects from Shelley’s
“Prometheus Unbound” seems to have been no
less barren of results. The only drawings from
Rossetti’s hand that remain to us from that portfolio
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>are an illustration of Keats’s “Belle Dame sans
Merci;” a study from Coleridge’s “Genevieve,”
over which he sat up a whole night, completing it
at daybreak, and a sketch of “Gretchen in the
Chapel” from Goethe’s “Faust.” The society included
Walter Howell Deverell, an artist of rare
delicacy and grace, and a man of singular personal
charm, destined to play a memorable part in the
life-history of Rossetti; F.G. Stephens, an intimate
friend of Holman Hunt; Thomas Woolner,
a young sculptor whose acquaintance Rossetti had
made at the Academy Schools; J.A. Vinter, now
well known as a portrait painter; and such lesser
though by no means insignificant lights as J.B.
Keene, F. Watkins, William Dennis, John Hancock,
J.T. Clifton, and N.E. Green. It was
evident that among the rising generation of
painters, long before the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood,—even before Hunt or
Rossetti had entered definitely upon such art training
as they ever had—the revolt against the tyranny
of the Academy was already begun, and even those
least in sympathy with the Pre-Raphaelite idea
found themselves drawn towards Rossetti and his
friends in a common disaffection with the existing
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>régime</em></span>. Moreover, the success of Millais, who at
the age of seventeen had gained the highest
academic prize for historical painting, and was
already earning well with his book-illustrations in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>black and white, afforded a valuable connecting-link
with a larger circle of critics and sympathizers
from whom were drawn some of the most faithful
aides-de-camp of the Pre-Raphaelite campaign.</p>

<p class='c000'>The poetry of Keats afforded at all events an
inexhaustable treasure-house of subject-matter for
the young painters, not only in their first efforts
towards the romantic revival, but for many years
then to come. “The Eve of St. Agnes,” for
example, afterwards yielded the theme of the
picture regarded by some critics as Millais’s
greatest work, as well as of the first important
painting by Holman Hunt, “The Flight of
Madeline and Porphyro.” This was completed
at Millais’s studio, at his home in Gower Street,
early in 1848, and exhibited in the Royal Academy
of that year; Millais having been at work meanwhile
upon his “Cymon and Iphigenia.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not until the autumn of 1848 that a
definite attempt was made to band together, in
a common purpose and under a distinctive name,
those of the little company of students and friends
who were prepared to accept and follow openly
the principle of fidelity to Nature in general and
to the romantic conception of Nature in particular,—the
conception, namely, of the physical world as
the veil and vehicle of an immanent spirit, fateful,
mysterious, and occult. An informal meeting was
held at Rossetti’s studio, then at 83, Newman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Street, and seven members enrolled themselves
under the name of “The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.”
The union consisted of Rossetti, Millais,
Holman Hunt, William Michael Rossetti, the
younger brother of the painter, Thomas Woolner,
F.G. Stephens, and James Collinson—the least
stable of the Brotherhood and the first seceder
from its ranks. In the Academy of that year a
picture by Collinson had already been exhibited,
entitled “The Charity Boy’s Début.” He was
a painter of uncertain artistic <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>calibre</em></span>, and of a
lethargic and mystical temperament; converted
to Pre-Raphaelitism by the ardour of Rossetti,
but shortly forsaking his art studies and joining
the Roman Catholic communion with a view of
qualifying for the priesthood. This ambition also
was subsequently given up, and, thus vacillating
between the church and the studio, his probation
ended in no particular career. The remaining
members of the Brotherhood—apart from the
leading painters—may be said to represent the
minor literature of the movement. F.G. Stephens
and W.M. Rossetti have attained permanent
distinction as art-critics, while Thomas Woolner,
before winning his later fame as a sculptor, gave
in the form of poetry his chief contribution to the
early propaganda of the Brotherhood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rules laid down as to method in painting,—such
as, that every subject and accessory should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>be studied direct from nature, and from one model—do
not seem to have been stringently enforced:
indeed in one of Rossetti’s most rigidly Pre-Raphaelite
pictures, “Ecce Ancilla Domini,” the
face of the Virgin was avowedly painted from
several models, while in that of the Angel the
artist has produced a curious blending of his
brother’s features with those of another sitter.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is improbable that an aversion to the one-model
rule, which has been attributed to Ford
Madox Brown as a reason for holding aloof from
the Brotherhood, had very much to do with his
decision to remain independent of it. Mr. Madox
Brown was from the first in cordial sympathy with
the movement, and on terms of intimate friendship
with its leaders, but he foresaw the dangers of an
artistic clique, and, perhaps, the impossibility of
permanent consonance of method between temperaments
so diverse as those of the seven
members enlisted. Nor was his own strong and
individualistic style of painting quite in harmony
with the manner of his younger friends. He was
pre-eminently an historical painter; and the critical
and romantic treatment of history, though bordering
very closely on Pre-Raphaelite ground, hardly
came within the immediate scope of the Brotherhood.
Though frequently acknowledged by his
later critics as the father—or sometimes the grandfather—of
the Pre-Raphaelite movement, Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Madox Brown consistently disclaimed any such
title, and did so with no less justice than modesty.
At the same time, his work was so intimately connected
with that of the men whom he powerfully
influenced and inspired that it may fairly be studied
side by side with theirs in illustration of the dominant
principles common to all.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the autumn of 1848 it was agreed that the
three chief painters should select their next subjects
from Keats’s “Isabella.” Millais, at that
time under the influence of Hunt rather than of
Rossetti (who indeed was still far from adopting
any definite line of <em>technique</em>), decided upon a
scene depicting Lorenzo at supper with Isabella
and her brothers. The pensive and earnest face
of Lorenzo was painted from W.M. Rossetti.
Mrs. Hodgkinson, the wife of Millais’s half-brother,
sat for Isabella. It would not be easy to
disprove Holman Hunt’s generous but weighty
verdict on the finished picture, as “the most wonderful
painting that any youth still under twenty
years of age ever did in the world.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Hunt and Rossetti, however, were not so steadfast
in their adhesion to the agreement as to the
choice of subjects from Keats. Hunt indeed
planned, and probably commenced about this
time, his afterwards notable picture, “Isabella
and the Pot of Basil;” but this, though taking
rank among the best examples of his earlier style,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>was not finally painted until 1867. He decided to
finish, for the next Academy, a picture already in
hand, “Rienzi swearing revenge over the body of
his brother.” In this design the figure of Colonna,
who endeavours to pacify the would-be avenger,
was painted from W.M. Rossetti, while Dante
Rossetti sat for the head of Rienzi,—and neglected,
in spite of much urging from his comrades, to fulfil
his own share in the “Isabella” project; but pursued
work upon the most original and remarkable
of his early pictures, “The Girlhood of Mary
Virgin.” Prior to this, he had proposed, and
partly sketched, a design entitled, “Retro me,
Sathana,” representing a young girl walking, and
earnestly reading, in a cloister, in the company of
a venerable priest, while the retreating figure of
Satan threatens her from the shade. This conception
was never carried out; but it is probable that
the now familiar sonnet bearing the same title was
written about this time. The only painting of any
note hitherto accomplished by Rossetti was a life-size
and nearly half-length portrait of his father,
finished in this same year 1848, and commissioned
and bought by his godfather, Mr. Charles Lyell,
of Kinnordy, Forfar, the father of the eminent
geologist. This was the only male portrait
Rossetti ever did in oils. In his new picture,
“The Girlhood of Mary Virgin,” (called at first
“The Education of the Virgin”) the face of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>lovely child-angel was painted from a young half-sister
of Woolner (though greatly modified, if not
wholly re-painted, afterwards); while St. Joiachim
was taken from an old family servant, and Saint
Anna and St. Mary from Mrs. Rossetti and Miss
Christina Rossetti respectively.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the spring of 1849 the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood
held their first “private view” with three
important pictures, Rossetti’s “Girlhood,” Hunt’s
“Rienzi,” and Millais’s “Lorenzo and Isabella,”
duly signed and <a id='corr67'></a><ins class='correction' title='sic'>monogramed</ins> with the initials
P.R.B. after the painters’ names, ready for exhibition;
the first appearing at the Free Gallery
(formerly known as the Chinese Gallery), Hyde
Park Corner, then under the management of the
Association for Promoting the Free Exhibition of
Modern Art, the other two at the Royal Academy,
where they were favourably hung. Rossetti’s
picture was sold to the Marchioness of Bath on
“private view” day for £80, and Hunt’s “Rienzi”
found a purchaser soon afterwards. “Lorenzo
and Isabella,” sold for £100 in 1849, was bought
in 1883 by the Corporation of Liverpool for
£1,120.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tour on the Continent with Holman Hunt in
September, 1849, gave Rossetti fresh inspiration
from the early Italian masters and the best representatives
of the Dutch school. The impressions
made upon him in his twenty-first year by travel in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>France and Belgium are recorded for us in the
wonderfully vivid and sharply-cut vignette-poems
of this period. Eager as ever for emotional experience,
and with the divine passion of hero-worship
strong upon him, his holiday among the
great painters was a delightsome pilgrimage, full
of suggestion and stimulus for future work. In
Paris, the sight of Giorgione’s great idyll in the
Louvre, “A Venetian Pastoral,” drew from the
young tourist a sonnet unsurpassed for sheer verbal
colour and atmosphere by any of his later poems.
Here, too, were written the great memorial sonnets,
“Place de la Bastille,” and “The Staircase of
Notre Dame.” On the cliffs at Boulogne Rossetti
wrote “Sea-Limits.” He</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>—“climbed the stair in Antwerp church,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Van Eyck and Memmeling at Bruges, Leonardo,
Fra Angelico, Giorgione, and Titian in Paris,
lacked no due meed of homage from Rossetti and
Hunt.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is remarkable that Rossetti never visited
Italy, nor even retained, in later years, the patriotic
sentiment which had so strongly pervaded
the home life of his boyhood.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>On the return of the travellers to London, a
new development was proposed and accomplished
in the public propaganda of the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood. It was decided to issue a monthly
magazine for the promulgation of Pre-Raphaelite
principles in painting and poetry. Members and
sympathizers met at Rossetti’s studio in Newman
Street to discuss the project, and decide upon the
title and contents of the manifesto. The suggestion
of Mr. Cave Thomas was ultimately adopted,
that it should be called “The Germ.” The first
number, extending to forty-eight large octavo pages,
illustrated with etchings, appeared in January, 1850,
published by Messrs. Aylott and Jones, of 8, Paternoster
Row. The primary tenet with regard to
art was thus enunciated in the preface: “The
endeavour held in view throughout the writings
on Art will be to encourage and enforce an entire
adherence to the simplicity of nature.” It would
be captious, perhaps, to argue, in the face of so
ingenuous an implication, that nature is not simple,
but, alas! infinitely and fatefully complex without
and within; presenting to the seer’s eye a tangled
web of visible phenomena no less intricate than
the secret woof of destiny whose threads are the
lives of men. To young minds, as to a young
world, the vision of nature broadly outlined in
generalities and clear with purpose is one of the
fairest of illusions. The sternest discipline of life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>is to discover chaos where we imagined order and
lucidity: to find interminable mazes and cross-roads
for our bewilderment where in the morning
mirage we had seen a plain path, an open road to
the Ideal. Then we cry that Nature, and not ourself,
is altered: that “there hath passed away a
glory from the earth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Happily, this disillusionment was yet far off in
the future of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. In
the preface to “The Germ,” a special claim was
made for poetry in its relation to the principles of
simplicity of expression already enforced in painting;
and with better reason, since painting must
perforce speak exclusively by the representation
of visible things, while poetry reaches directly to
their inner significance. For while the painter
strives so to order and depict the phenomena
around him as to arrive at some sort of moral
simplicity in the effect of his picture, the poet—if
he be a seer—penetrates at once to the spirit of
his theme, and clothes it at his own will with
symbolic or dramatic expression. Hence the application
of the Pre-Raphaelite principle to the
writing of poetry was even more fruitful than in
painting; and produced in modern English ballad
and lyric verse, and even in the best prose of our
own generation, a swift and incisive directness of
touch, a broad and vivid clarity of impression, never
so fully effected in the pictorial medium.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>The first literary <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>débutant</em></span> in “The Germ” was
Mr. Woolner, who occupied the opening pages of
the January number with two short poems admirably
illustrative, within their unpretentious scope
and modest aim, of that naïve simplicity in the
handling of complexities—the eternal childlikeness
of pure romance—which is inherent in almost all
great art. “My Beautiful Lady” and “Of my
Lady in Death” were accompanied by an etching
in two parts by Holman Hunt. Then followed
an unsigned sonnet by Ford Madox Brown, and a
paper by Mr. J.L. Tupper on “The Subject in
Art.” Mr. Coventry Patmore contributed anonymously
a poem called “The Seasons,” and <a id='corr71'></a><ins class='correction' title='Mr'>Mr.</ins>
Tupper was also represented in verse. Criticism
of contemporary poetry was afforded by W.M.
Rossetti’s paper on Arthur Hugh Clough. The
remaining pages were worthily filled by the two
greatest poets of the Pre-Raphaelite movement,
Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti: the latter
with “Dreamlands” and another short lyric, signed
“Ellen Alleyn,” the former with “My Sister’s
Sleep,” a characteristic example of his earliest
manner, written in the then uncommon metre since
naturalized in our language by Tennyson’s “In
Memoriam,” and the wonderful prose allegory
“Hand and Soul.” This poem—as verily it
should be called, with its rich and haunting diction
and its magical rhythm of imagery—is almost the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>sole example of Rossetti’s strength in prose, only
paralleled by a similar composition, entitled “St.
Agnes of Intercession,” of a later date. “Hand
and Soul” is largely autobiographical in its narrative,
being the story of a young art student of
Arezzo, named Chiaro dell’Erma, possessed by
new and high ideals of the painters mission, and
stimulated to the better application of his own
talents by the success of a younger comrade,—as
we may well believe Rossetti to have been stirred
and impelled by the progress of the more studious
and at the same time more fortunate Millais. The
speech of Chiaro in “Hand and Soul” may be
taken as a declaration of Rossetti’s artistic faith
and principles at that period.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second number of “The Germ,” though no
less interesting and significant in subject-matter,
did not increase the scant support accorded to the
venture by the public at large; and since the expense
of such an issue was too heavy to be borne
by the little band of young and struggling aspirants
responsible for its existence, the future of the magazine
had to be seriously reconsidered by the
Brotherhood. Mr. Tupper, however, to whose
hands the printing had been entrusted, came to
the rescue, and gave “The Germ” a new lease of
life under the title of “Art and Poetry.” The
change did not serve to commend the somewhat
crude propaganda to the mind of the British
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Philistine, and after the April number the issue
was reluctantly given up; but not until its pages
had glowed with the first fires, at least, of Rossetti’s
noblest poetic inspiration. Here first appeared
“The Blessed Damozel,” for which we might surely
paraphrase the words of Holman Hunt on Millais,
and call it “the most wonderful poem that any
youth still under twenty years of age ever did in
the world.” Here, too, were the lyric first-fruits of
his continental tour (if sonnets may, by elasticity
of definition, be included in lyric poetry), “The
Carillon,” “From the Cliffs—Noon,” afterwards
called “Sea-Limits,” “Pax Vobis,” largely rewritten
later and entitled “World’s Worth,” and
the sonnets on “A Virgin and Child,” “A Marriage
of St. Katherine,” “A Dance of Nymphs” (from
Andrea Mantegna, in the Louvre), “A Venetian
Pastoral” (from Giorgione, in the Louvre), and
<a id='corr73'></a><ins class='correction' title='Ruggiero'>“Ruggiero</ins> and Angelica” (from the picture by
Ingres).</p>

<p class='c000'>Among other contents of “The Germ” and
“Art and Poetry” may be mentioned Ford Madox
Brown’s paper on “The Structure of an Historical
Picture,” John Orchard’s “Dialogue on Art,” and
Coventry Patmore’s “Criticism of Macbeth.” Mr.
F.G. Stephens wrote under the pseudonym of
“John Seward,” and the publication was edited by
W.M. Rossetti, then twenty years of age. Yet
one more poet remains in the list of contributors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>James Collinson, whose somewhat desultory but
genuinely imaginative lines, “The Child Jesus:
a record typical of the five sorrowful mysteries,”
together with an etching by the same hand, illustrate
very markedly the peculiar phase of religious
symbolism, combined with half-ascetic, half-æsthetic
melancholy, upon which the Pre-Raphaelites
were entering at this period, and which remained
with one, at least, of their leaders, as a permanent
and dominating element in the artistic work of a
lifetime.</p>

<p class='c000'>But while “The Germ” was speeding through its
brief career, and achieving at all events some sort of
<em>apologia</em> for the <a id='corr74_13'></a><ins class='correction' title='Pre-Raphalite'>Pre-Raphaelite</ins> Brotherhood, the
leading band of painters were further expressing
and developing their principles on canvas. For
the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1850, Millais
had prepared two pictures destined to draw down
upon himself the concentrated fury of that storm of
vituperative criticism from the public press which
raged unabated for five years around the work of
the Brethren, and ultimately spent itself on their
more or less worthy disciples and successors. It is
remarkable that the chief burden of the abuse
heaped upon the <a id='corr74_24'></a><ins class='correction' title='Pre-Rephaelites'>Pre-Raphaelites</ins> by the art
censors of the period should have been borne in
the first instance by one, in some respects the
most brilliant of the band, who in after years
departed more entirely from his early principles in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>painting than any other member of the Brotherhood,
and gained thereby a far greater measure of
general popularity than has been won, or is likely
to be won at present, by any of his former comrades.
Upon no example of Pre-Raphaelite work
were the diatribes of the press more scathing than
upon Millais’s two pictures of 1850, “Christ in the
House of His Parents,” (often called “The Carpenter’s
Shop”), and “Ferdinand Lured by Ariel.”
“Men who knew nothing of art,” says a fellow-member
of the Brotherhood, Mr. F.G. Stephens,
“reviled Millais because he was not of the art,
artistic. Dilettanti, who could not draw a fingertip,
scolded one of the most accomplished draughtsmen
of the age because he delineated what he saw.
Cognoscenti, who could not paint, rebuked the
most brilliant Gold Medal student of the Royal
Academy on account of his technical proceedings.
Critics of the most rigid views belaboured and
shrieked at an original genius, whose struggles
and whose efforts they could not understand.
Intolerant and tyrannical commentators condemned
the youth of twenty because he dared to think for
himself.... Intense and unflinching fidelity to
nature, ardent love for colour, and a rigid resolution
to paint the light of day as brightly as pigments
could allow him, were among the aims of
Millais, who, following the principles he championed
with all his heart, found his models among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>his friends of English birth, and failing Eastern
types, employed all his skill on British materials,
relying on the really devout spirit in which he
worked, and the poetic quality of his design, to
produce the effect desired. He was sorely disappointed
in this reliance.” No less sane a journal
than Charles Dickens’s “Household Words,” thus
wrote on June 15:—“In coming before this Holy
Family you must discharge from your mind all
religious aspirations, all elevating thoughts, all
tender, awful, sorrowful, ennobling, sacred, graceful,
or beautiful associations, and prepare yourself for
the lowest depth of what is mean, odious, repulsive,
and revolting. You behold the interior of a
carpenter’s shop. In the foreground is a hideous,
wry-necked, blubbering, red-headed boy in a bed-gown,
and at his side a kneeling woman so horrible
in her ugliness that she would stand out from the
rest of the company as a monster in the vilest
cabaret in France, or the lowest gin-shop in England.
The two almost naked carpenters might be
undressed in any hospital where dirty drunkards
in a high state of varicose veins are received.
Their very toes have walked out of St. Giles’s.”
Another writer likened the figure of the boy
Christ, whose hand, in the picture, has been
wounded at his task, to “a miserable child scratching
itself against a rusty nail in Seven Dials.”
To such criticism it might easily be retorted that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>world is more deeply concerned to-day with the
dark problems of Seven Dials and St. Giles’s than
with the life of any child in history, save in so far as
the latter may illumine and interpret the mysteries
of the importunate hour; and that the painter who
so translates into present-day life the eternal
tragedy of toil and pain as to press home to the
conscience of a nation the daily re-crucifixion of
the Christ in its own vast labour-houses,—whose
modern reading of the ancient tale suggests the
divine potentialities of all childhood and the
universal pathos of human love “wounded in the
house of friends,”—has given us a greater picture,
and a more religious picture, than if he had painted
for us all the angels in Heaven.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ferdinand Lured by Ariel” may be taken as
the first landscape produced by the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood. It was painted—according to the
rule—directly from nature. The background was
taken from a spot in a park attached to Shotover
House, near Oxford, where Millais was staying as
the guest of Mr. Drury. A lady who saw the young
artist at work upon this subject distinctly recalls his
application of a magnifying-glass to the branch of a
tree he was painting, in order to study closely the
veins of the leaves. This was a literal following of
that patient analysis of minutiæ in nature which
characterized the Italian Pre-Raphaelites, and is
especially noticeable in the early landscapes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Leonardo da Vinci; though he departed in his maturity
from his former love of detail, and began to
conventionalize items into generalities. Even the
lizards in the foreground of “Ferdinand and Ariel”
were faithful portraits of certain small favourites
brought by Millais from Jersey to serve their turn
among his sitters. The friend who sat for Ferdinand
relates that the painting of the face, though a
marvel of finish, and perfect in technique, was
accomplished in a single sitting. A detailed pencil
drawing was already on the canvas, and the laying
on of the colour occupied only five hours. The
vivid colouring of the whole picture, and the use of
metal instead of pigment for the gold-cloth worn
by Ferdinand (after the method of the early Italian
masters, followed also by Rossetti in “Ecce Ancilla
Domini”), were the subject of scarcely less vehement
denunciation by the critics than the painter’s treatment
of the Holy Family. “We do not want,” they
said, “to see Ariel and the Spirits of the enchanted
isle in the attitudes and shapes of green goblins, or
the gallant Ferdinand twisted like a posture-master
by Albrecht Dürer.... A Ferdinand of most
ignoble physiognomy is being lured by a pea-green
monster, intended for Ariel, whilst a row of sprites,
such as it takes a Millais to devise, watch the
operation with turquoise eyes. It would occupy
more room than the thing is worth to expose all
the absurdity and impertinence of this work.”</p>

<p class='c005'>From such extravagance of hostility the efforts
of Holman Hunt were spared for the present; and
his contribution to the Academy of 1850, “Christian
Priests Escaping from Druid Persecution”
(better known as “The Christian Missionary,”)
though sharing in the general condemnation of the
Pre-Raphaelite “heresy and schism,” was not
singled out for special objurgation. Rossetti’s
great achievement of the year was the most beautiful,
and at the same time the most dramatic, of
his strictly Pre-Raphaelite work, the “Ecce Ancilla
Domini” (“The Annunciation,”) now in the
National Gallery. The first rough sketch for this
picture—a small water-colour not more than six
inches by four—was painted as early as 1847 in
the Cleveland Street studio shared with Hunt.
The completed work was rejected by the Academy,
and seen only in the <a id='corr79'></a><ins class='correction' title='obsure'>obscure</ins> little Portland Gallery
in Regent Street.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the following season brought a larger
measure of opprobrium to Holman Hunt. In the
autumn of 1850 he had spent some weeks with
Rossetti at Sevenoaks, Kent, and there painted
the greater portion of his picture for the next
year’s Academy, “Valentine rescuing Sylvia from
Proteus;” a scene from Shakespeare’s “Two
Gentlemen of Verona.” The beech-tree forest
background was painted in Lord Amherst’s park
at Knowle, and Mr. James Lennox Hannay (who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>died in 1873) was the model for Valentine. The
whole work was characterized by the same bold
colouring and exuberance of highly wrought
detail, the same rugged unconventionality of pose
and gesture in the composition of the figures, that
had so incensed the organs of Academic tradition
in the previous year. Its appearance in the
Academy of 1851 evoked a fresh outburst of
official contumely, in which the painter of “Valentine
and Sylvia” (as it was ultimately called), was
no less severely dealt with than his comrade
Millais, who exhibited at the same time “The
Return of the Dove to the Ark,” “Mariana of
the Moated Grange,” and “The Woodman’s
Daughter”—one of the finest combinations of Pre-Raphaelite
landscape with the peculiar intensity of
figure-drawing and character-study which was a
dominant motive with the Brotherhood at this
period. The assailant critics again sought to cover
insinuations of gracelessness and deformity of
conception beneath the looser charge of defective
technique.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was at this juncture that Mr. Ruskin, then
personally unknown to the Pre-Raphaelites, and
hearing privately of their aims and endeavours
through Mr. Coventry Patmore, took upon himself
to espouse their cause, perhaps with more ardour
than discrimination, and wrote, in the spring of
1851, the now famous Letters to the “Times”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>which constituted the first public and authoritative
vindication of the Pre-Raphaelite movement.</p>

<p class='c000'>That Mr. Ruskin may have taken the early
achievement and promise of the young painters a
little too seriously, and attributed to them a more
exalted conception of their mission as prophets
and reformers than they actually cherished, and
that he did undoubtedly misinterpret certain
aspects of their religious paintings, is now widely
acknowledged; nor need we hesitate to say that
his influence upon the movement from first to last
has been considerably exaggerated. Yet it is
unquestionable that the first inspiration of Pre-Raphaelitism
was largely due to his writings, and
that his open championship of Hunt and Millais at
a crisis of popular feeling rendered immense service
to their crusade against the blind Philistinism
of the British <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>bourgeoisie</em></span>. Replying at once to the
technical indictments, Mr. Ruskin said:—“There
was not a single error in perspective in three out
of the four pictures in question [‘The Woodman’s
Daughter,’ ‘Mariana of the Moated Grange,’
‘The Return of the Dove to the Ark,’ and
‘Valentine and Sylvia’].... I doubt if, with
the exception of the pictures of David Roberts,
there were one architectural drawing in perspective
on the walls of the Academy; I never met with
but two men in my life who knew enough of perspective
to draw a Gothic arch in a retiring plane,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>so that its lateral dimensions and curvatures might
be calculated to scale from the drawing. Our
architects certainly do not, and it was but the other
day that, talking to one of the most distinguished
among them, I found he actually did not know how
to draw a circle in perspective.... There is not
a single study of drapery in the whole Academy,
be it in large works or small, which for perfect
truth, power, and finish, could be compared with
the black sleeve of Julia, or with the velvet on the
breast and the chain mail of Valentine, of Mr.
Hunt’s picture; or with the white draperies on the
table of Mr. Millais’s ‘Mariana.’ And further:
that as studies both of drapery and of every minor
detail, there has been nothing in art so earnest or
so complete as these pictures since the days of
Albrecht Dürer. This I assert generally and
fearlessly.” “Let us only look around at our
exhibitions,”—continued the writer, proceeding to
compare the work of the Pre-Raphaelites with the
current standard of academic art—“and behold the
cattle-pieces, and sea-pieces, and fruit-pieces, and
family-pieces, the eternal brown cows in ditches,
and white sails in squalls, and sliced lemons in
saucers, and foolish faces in simpers, and try and
feel what we are, and what we might have been.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Ruskin’s letters to the “Times” were revised
and republished a few years later in pamphlet
form, introduced by the following statement in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>preface:—“Eight years ago, in the close of the
first volume of ‘Modern Painters,’ I ventured to
give this advice to the young artists of England:
That they should go to Nature in all singleness of
heart, and walk with her, laboriously and trustingly,
having no other thought but how best to penetrate
her meaning; rejecting nothing, selecting nothing,
and scorning nothing: advice which, whether bad
or good, involved infinite labour and humiliation
in the following it; and was therefore, for the most
part, rejected. It has, however, at last been
carried out, to the very letter, by a group of men
who, for their reward, have been assailed with the
most scurrilous abuse which I ever recollect seeing
issue from the public press.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon this endorsement of the Pre-Raphaelite
aim there followed an indictment of the Raphaelesque
tradition still surviving in the training-schools
of British art, in a passage which, through much
quotation, has now become a familiar example of
the controversial literature of the Pre-Raphaelite
movement. “We begin,” said Mr. Ruskin, “in
all probability, by telling the youth of fifteen or
sixteen that Nature is full of faults, and that he is
to improve her; but that Raphael is perfection,
and that the more he copies Raphael the better;
that after much copying of Raphael he is to try
what he can do himself in a Raphaelesque but yet
original manner; that is to say, he is to try to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>something very clever, all out of his own head, but
yet this clever something is to be properly subjected
to Raphaelesque rules, is <a id='corr84'></a><ins class='correction' title='to to'>to</ins> have a principal
light, occupying one-seventh of its space, and
a principal shadow, occupying one-third of the
same; that no two people’s heads in the picture
are to be turned the same way, and that all the
personages represented are to possess ideal beauty
of the highest order, which ideal beauty consists
partly in a Greek outline of nose, partly in proportions
expressible in decimal fractions between the
lips and the chin; but partly also in that degree of
improvement which the youth of sixteen is to
bestow upon God’s work in general.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not difficult to trace, in the light of those
utterances, the point of departure between Mr.
Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelites in their conception
of that universe of Nature which they had studied
with the like faithful care. Revolting from the
quasi-perfection of Raphaelesque art, Ruskin had
thrown himself upon Nature with the confidence
of finding in her the absolute perfection vainly
sought in the work of man. He had embraced
without question the monistic theory of Nature as
essentially beneficent and beautiful, and had never
faced the principal of dualism which has been and
must yet remain the crux of modern philosophy.
Hence he failed to grasp the more romantic and
subtle conception of the physical world as the scene,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and not the drama, of life, which was immanent in
the beginnings and revealed with the maturity of
the Pre-Raphaelite movement. It has been remarked
by an astute critic that three of the greatest
writers of the Victorian age—Ruskin, Carlyle, and
Browning—have been ruined as thinkers by their
ignorance of the law of Evolution, with all that it
implies of waste and suffering, of sacrifice and conflict
and loss. Ruskin’s philosophy of nature was
founded upon an old and discredited cosmogony;
and however remote may have been the thought
of the Pre-Raphaelite painters from the purely intellectual
conclusions of physical and mental science
in the nineteenth century, however apart they may
have lived from theological and ethical controversy,
it can safely be said that no contemporary artist
save Tennyson, in poetry or painting, has imbibed
more completely that spirit of mystical and irresponsible
conflict with Nature which they drew from
the atmosphere of mediæval romance. They understood
that he who returns to Nature, returns, as
another writer has bluntly expressed it, to a great
many ugly things. “We need,” says Mr. Frederic
Harrison, “as little think the natural world all
beauty as think it all horror. It is made up of
loveliness and ghastliness, of harmony and chaos,
of agony, joy, life, death. The nature-worshippers
are blind and deaf to the waste and the shrieks
which meet the seeker after truth. What a mass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>there is in Nature which is appalling—almost
maddening to man, if we coolly resolve to look at
all the facts, as facts!”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a> It was well that the Pre-Raphaelite
painters should return, as they did, to
the reverent and unbiassed portrayal of the natural
world as it presented itself to their eyes. That
they should follow with absolute fidelity the phenomena
around them, “rejecting nothing, selecting
nothing, and scorning nothing,” was the essential
preparation for artistic reform. But that they
should advance from such a discipline to something
of the selectiveness of fine art, was a step from the
analytic method to a constructive effort based on
that analysis and not—as in the Raphaelesque
convention—independent of it. In all the highest
Pre-Raphaelite work we feel instinctively that
Nature is not the subject, but only the accessory,
of the painting. Undoubtedly the new note struck
in 1849 was, as Ruskin says, a note of resistance
and defiance. But the revolutionary impulse had
yet to be developed on reconstructive lines; and
this development, though powerfully stimulated by
the independent genius of Millais in the first four
years of the Brotherhood, passed ultimately into
the hands of Rossetti and Holman Hunt.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Ruskin’s championship of Hunt and Millais
when the powers of orthodoxy were against them
and their friends were few, and his no less generous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>patronage of Rossetti in the succeeding years, did
much to turn the current of critical favour in the
direction of the Pre-Raphaelite ideal. Hunt’s
picture, “Valentine and Sylvia,” after its merciless
ordeal of ridicule and abuse in London, was rewarded
by a £50 prize at the Academy of
Liverpool,—the first English city to give public
recognition and support to the rising school. The
story of the steadfast encouragement accorded to
the Pre-Raphaelites by the Liverpool Academy
during the next six years, in which the annual prize
of £50 was granted in every instance to pictures
either by Millais, Holman Hunt, Ford Madox
Brown, or a painter of kindred aims—Mark
Anthony,—and of the dissensions which arose in
and round the Academic Council when in 1857 the
prize was once more won by Millais, affords an
interesting side light upon the artistic controversy
of the period. A leading literary newspaper
attacked the Liverpool Academy in the bitterest
terms for what it called “the Pre-Raphaelite
heresy,” and Mr. Ruskin again came forward in
the press to the defence of the painters. In the
following year another nomination of Madox Brown
by the Council for the award in question brought
the strife to a crisis; the Town Council withdrew
its financial support from the Academy, and rival
exhibitions were opened, resulting in failure on
both sides. Time, however, worked a significant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>revenge. Not long after the press attack upon the
Academy Council, one of the original members of
the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Mr. F.G.
Stephens, was appointed art-critic of the very
journal that had so violently forsworn “the Pre-Raphaelite
heresy.” Twenty years later, the finest
English art gallery outside London was erected in
Liverpool through the munificence of Mr. (afterwards
Sir) A.B. Walker, recently deceased; and
yielded some of the most important spaces on its
walls to pictures of the highest level of the English
Pre-Raphaelite school.</p>

<p class='c000'>The history of the last two decades has indeed
wrought a sufficient vindication of the general
methods of these young painters, and supremely
of their practice as colourists; and it is in the
sphere of the colourist that their influence upon
contemporary art has made itself felt more deeply,
perhaps, than in any other branch of technique.
But to the vindication of history has been added
in recent years, by the painter most bitterly
attacked at the time for his innovations in colour—Sir
John Millais—a defence which has now
become almost an aphorism in English studios.
“<em>Time</em> and <em>Varnish</em> are two of the greatest Old
Masters,” says the artist, writing in 1888 under
the title “Some Thoughts on our Art of To-day”;
“and their merits are too often attributed by
critics to the painters of the pictures they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>toned and mellowed. The great artists all painted
in <em>bright</em> colours, such as it is the fashion now-a-days
for men to decry as crude and vulgar, never
suspecting that what they applaud in those works
is merely the result of what they condemn in their
contemporaries. The only way to judge of the
treasures which the old masters of whatever age
have left us, is to look at the work and ask oneself
‘What was that like when it was new?’ Take
the ‘Bacchus and Ariadne’ in the National
Gallery, with its splendid red robe and its rich
brown grass. You may rest assured that the
painter of that red robe never painted the grass
brown. He saw the colour as it was and painted
it as it was—distinctly green; only it has faded
with time to its present beautiful mellow colour.
Yet many men now-a-days will not have a picture
with green in it; some even going so far, in giving
a commission, as to stipulate that the canvas shall
contain none of it. But God Almighty has given
us green, and you may depend upon it, it’s a fine
colour.”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The writer then describes the gradual fall of
Sir Joshua Reynolds before the short-sighted
demand for “subdued colour” which had become
current among the art <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>connoisseurs</em></span> of his day, and
which at last induced him, against his better judgment,
to create immediate “tone,” at the sacrifice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>of durability, by the use of that pernicious medium,
asphaltum; with the result that all his extant work
so accomplished is now in a deplorable state of
decomposition and ruin.</p>

<p class='c000'>With such examples before them of the evil of
yielding to the demands of ignorance, and lowering
in any way one’s standard of practice before a
popular cry, the Pre-Raphaelite Brothers, whose
first word in art sounded, as Ruskin said, the note
of resistance and defiance, did not scruple to make
merry over the weaknesses of a school of painting
founded on Sir Joshua Reynold’s “Discourses.”
Mr. Madox Brown tells us how Rossetti loved to
quote from the diary of B.R. Haydon:—“Locked
my door and dashed at my picture with a brush
dripping with asphaltum.” But of Rossetti’s
cordial admiration for Haydon’s genius a contrasting
anecdote is evidence:—A friend, discussing
with him the relative merits of Haydon
and Wilkie, contended that the head of Lazarus
was the only fine thing Haydon ever produced.
“Ah!” burst out Rossetti, “but that one head is
worth all the puny Wilkie ever produced in his
life!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Rossetti’s practice, it may here be said, differed
from that of his Pre-Raphaelite comrades in the
matter of varnish. The strong impulse towards
the fresco-method, which was initiated in him, in
his student days, by Madox Brown and the Westminster
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Cartoon competitions, resulted in his
avoidance, throughout the best years of his work,
of glaze and sheen in painting. From the first,
Rossetti hated varnish: hence were developed
the fresco-like, pure, and lustreless depths of
colour which mark his finest technical level. But
his entire confidence in the “Old Master,” Time,
to enhance and vindicate his rich green glories in
drapery and background is sufficiently attested by
his unhesitating and masterly use of green in nearly
all his greatest pictures. Not even the verdant
gorgeousness of “Ferdinand and Ariel” can compare
with the deep, chastened splendour of the
green in “Beata Beatrix” and “Mnemosyne,” or
in “The Beloved,” “Veronica Veronese,” “La
Ghirlandata,” “The Blue Bower,” or, more daring
still, in the wonderful series of water-colours which
occupy the transition period of Rossetti’s Pre-Raphaelite
work.</p>

<p class='c005'>While Millais and Holman Hunt were
outwardly dominant in the region of
reform, and, in the exhibitions of 1850–51,
were leading the Brotherhood Militant boldly
into the enemy’s camp, Rossetti was entering upon
a phase of doubt and perplexity, of self-distrust
and hesitation, which resolved itself into an important
crisis in his artistic development. A
variety of circumstances diverted him in 1850
from the special line of religious painting, exemplified
in “The Girlhood of Mary Virgin” and “Ecce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Ancilla Domini,” which had been the chief outlet
of his early enthusiasms in art,—if indeed so inadequate
a phrase be permissible in regard to
pictures which must rank with the purest products
of his genius in its pristine robustness and simplicity.
An incident in the studio-annals of the
Brotherhood now turned him aside from the
mediævo-religious manner adopted directly and
literally from the early Italian masters. Rossetti’s
convert and disciple, James Collinson, striving to
imitate afar off the sincere habit of his leader, set
to work upon a congruous subject, “The Renunciation
of St. Elizabeth,” and produced a picture
so mystical in conception and so hysterical in sentiment,
albeit not without a certain grace and
beauty of its own, that the sound and practical
good sense which tempered the mysticism of
Rossetti revolted at once from the extravagance
of such a style. He now perceived the danger
of pursuing too exclusively a path bordering on
the metaphysical and occult, and quickly sought
to brace and strengthen both his own imagination
and that of his comrade, by departing for a time
from the field of what is commonly called “sacred”
art, and seeking fresh inspirations in a less rarefied
air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other influences, chiefly of a personal kind,
began to play around Rossetti at this time. He
had moved, early in the year 1850, to a suite of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>rooms at 14, Chatham Place, Blackfriars; a block
of houses since demolished, but then hospitable
enough in a sober charm of environment; within
view of the river and the historic horizon of its
shores, and of certain grim but not wholly unromantic
vistas of the great metropolis. In this
home was spent the happiest decade of Rossetti’s
life. Here began, soon after his settlement in the
new abode, his friendship with the greatest poet
of the Victorian age, and with another conspicuous
in the second rank of its singers,—Tennyson and
Browning,—both destined to exercise a strong
influence on Rossetti’s art, though (singularly as it
happened) not on his poetry; which remained,
through years of intellectual intercourse and the
reading together of each other’s verse, absolutely
unaffected by either of the widely different poetic
styles of the then Laureate and his great contemporary.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not easy for a succeeding generation to
understand with what enthusiasm, with what
delight and invigoration, the little company of
painter-poets plunged into the writings of Browning
when, following Rossetti, who was first on the
track of the new fount of refreshment, they discovered
therein the tonic which they needed. No
better antidote to the sensuous mysticism into
which some of the Pre-Raphaelites were threatening
to lapse could have been found than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>wholesome modernity and salutary brusquerie of
the author of “Pauline” and “Bells and Pomegranates.”
It was probably because they stood
most in need of his gospel that the influence of
Browning was at first more strong upon the
readers than that of Tennyson, who affected them
in the direction of pure romance, and distilled for
them all that was sanest and noblest in the
mediæval world.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the autumn of 1850 Rossetti began, during
his stay with Hunt and F.G. Stephens at Sevenoaks,
a number of sketches with a view to a large
and elaborate picture of “Kate the Queen,” from
Browning’s well-known lyric. But he could never
satisfy himself with the design, and after much toil,
disheartenment, and perplexity, the subject was
abandoned, like many more promising themes
which from time to time inspired Rossetti. The
entire year, save for the success of “Ecce Ancilla
Domini,” had been one of disappointment to him,
and of disconsolate struggles for a new departure.
He had made many futile attempts at designs for
“The Germ,” but none pleased him, and now he was
casting about for new matter and media. For, as
his standard of excellence rose higher, he began to
feel more acutely his technical shortcomings,—the
results partly of his incomplete training and desultory
study in youth, partly of singular ill-luck
in his figure-models, and partly also of a curious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>constitutional deficiency—not of industry <em>per se</em>,
but of the faculty to direct and apply his industry
along right lines. No modern artist has disproved
more completely than Rossetti the barren platitude
which defines genius as “the capacity for taking
infinite pains.” Comparison between Rossetti and
Browning in their struggle with mental tendencies
unfavourable to lucid and well-ordered art is too
obvious to demand pursuit in detail. Both took
the prescribed “infinite pains,” but neither in the
most profitable directions. Browning was over-charged
with thought; Rossetti with imagination;
and both were cumbered with the difficulties of
artistic speech. The art of Browning has frequently
been pronounced crude, raw, and “undigested.”
One would hesitate to apply such
terms to any work of Rossetti’s; for his, even at
its most elemental stages, generally erred in the
direction of strained and laboured purism, being
over-wrought rather than unripe in conception or
performance. In both artists, an exuberant activity
of output was combined with a curious inability to
undergo the full discipline of just and coherent expression.
Browning’s prolific and incorrigible chaos
of diction and metre, and Rossetti’s want of balance
and sobriety in draughtsmanship, are but instances
of the too frequent impediments of genius in the
process of transmission. Rossetti, when he attained
perfection in technique—and that he did so absolutely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and repeatedly can no longer be questioned—seemed
to stumble on it, as we have already suggested,
by a sort of exquisite chance, a divine
surprise, rather than a logical issue. And, manfully
as he strove to recover in technical science,
and did indeed recover to a marvellous degree, the
lost ground of early days in a splendid maturity,
his sense of perfect drawing was too fine for him
not to suffer keenly—so long as that sense remained
unimpaired—from that inability to realize
at will his own ideals of perfection, which to every
true worker is the only thing to be called failure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Distracted as Rossetti was throughout his life
by the very richness and fertility of his own genius,
torn ever between divided aims and conflicting
purposes, the more mutually obstructive because
of the restless and hyper-sensitive nature which
was the field and victim of their strife, the difficulty
of concentrating that genius upon the highest
aim and purpose within its proper sphere was
never more stubborn than at this period. So
largely did the poetic impulse, in his youth, predominate
over the pictorial method, that, as he himself
declares in a letter written in retrospect, it
was not until 1853, when he was twenty-five years
of age, that he definitely adopted painting as his
life-study and profession, and relegated his literary
efforts to a subordinate place. Subordinate they
were in name and for a time only: to be put forth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>with fresh ardour and greater mastery at intervals
of his painting, and to surpass it in some respects
in the essentials of fine art. Rossetti had yet to
learn that he, even more than Hunt and Millais,
was primarily and supremely a colourist in the
broadest sense of the word.</p>

<p class='c000'>But a still deeper and more abiding influence
from the literature of the past was by this time
ascendant in Rossetti’s mind. The love of Dante,
already inherent in him, was nurtured by many
tender associations of youth: it now increased and
swayed him as a direct and urgent spiritual power.
In 1845 the vague spell of the old name upon the
young namesake had changed, for the latter, into
an eager study of his great poetic inheritance.
The magic and majestic visions of the “Purgatorio”
and “Paradiso,” and still more, the unforgettable
life-tragedy of their seer, had sunk deeply into
Rossetti’s thought, until, from his own recreative
alembic of fantasy, he began, about 1850, to bring
them forth again on paper and canvas, in a rich
and profuse miscellany of rough sketches and
brilliant vignettes and colour-studies, too often
left unfinished at a point of high promise and
alluring suggestions of success.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not difficult to trace, through the strange
parallels of circumstance and destiny, the sombre
charm that bound the exiled poet of the fourteenth
to him of the nineteenth century. It has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>said that no ascendancy of a great poetic personality
over one born in a later age has been more
potent and fruitful in art than that of Dante
Alighieri over Dante Gabriel Rossetti. In 1849–50
we find the latter sketching, first in ink and
then in colours, the historic or legendary meeting of
Dante and Beatrice Portinari at a marriage feast,
when Beatrice is said to have laughed with her
companions at the shyness and confusion of the
young patriot-guest. The second of these sketches
was severely criticised when exhibited in 1851–52,
on account of a daring juxtaposition of bright light
green and bright light blue in the colour scheme.
This bold experiment was afterwards defended by
Ruskin by analogy with the natural disposition of
green grass, etc., against a summer sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was at this time also that another new and
important personal influence came upon Rossetti’s
life. James Collinson had now separated from
the Brotherhood, and was succeeded, at all events
probationally, by Walter Howell Deverell, through
whom, by one of those strange chances which
sometimes modify in a moment the destinies of a
lifetime, Rossetti made the acquaintance of Miss
Elizabeth Eleanor Siddal; a young girl of such
remarkable beauty that Deverell at once asked her
to sit to him as a model, and introduced her to
Rossetti for the same purpose. The story runs to
the effect that Deverell, who was himself of singularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>handsome and winning presence, accidentally
caught sight of Miss Siddal’s face, with its regular,
delicate features and profusion of rich, dark auburn
hair, in the background of a shop-window where
she—the daughter of a Sheffield cutler—was engaged
as a milliner’s assistant. To Deverell,
being at that time in search of a model for his new
picture, “Viola,” from Shakespeare’s “Twelfth
Night,” the sight of such a face was doubly welcome.
He quickly made such frank and honourable
advances as his graces of person and character
facilitated, and Miss Siddal’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>début</em></span> in the studios
of the Brotherhood brought not only to Deverell
a perfect Viola, but to Rossetti an ideal and actual
Beatrice. For the young artists soon found their
model to be—in the old fairy-tale phrase—“as
good as she was beautiful.” Of that goodness and
beauty, that incomparable charm of talent and of
character, of manner and temperament, which soon
made her the centre of the warmest admiration
and affection, enough has long since been written,
by those who knew her, to render the tardy praise
of less qualified historians alike needless and impertinent.
The members of the Brotherhood vied
with each other in the endeavour to immortalize
her in their paintings. Rossetti, Hunt, and Millais
did so with unqualified success. Rossetti, in his
turn, discovered that she herself possessed extraordinary
aptitude for art. He gave her lessons in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>drawing and painting, and the two worked together
upon kindred ideals. Her presence in the studios
was soon upon the footing of equal friendship and
pleasant <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>cameraderie</em></span>. The vigour of her imagination
is best seen in a water-colour drawing, “Sir
Patrick Spens,” in Mr. Theodore Watts’s collection.
It represents the wives of the men on the doomed
ship waiting in agonized expectancy upon the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon a different and deeper attachment sprang
up between teacher and pupil. Her exquisite
spirit, her gracious ways, appealed as deeply to
Rossetti’s sensitive and passionate nature as did
her beauty to his æsthetic judgment. His love for
her was as the gathering up of all the scattered
forces of his being into one consecrated worship.
It may well be that the progress of courtship was
not invariably favourable to the progress of art, but
several rough portraits by Rossetti of himself and
Miss Siddal, and of Rossetti by his fair companion,
remain as pleasant witnesses of idle hours, and are
at the same time drawn with singular vividness
and force.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in 1851, or perhaps at the close of the
previous year, Miss Siddal appears to have given
sittings to Holman Hunt for the face of Sylvia in
his picture of “Valentine and Sylvia,” already referred
to. Rossetti sat with her as the Jester in
Walter Deverell’s “Viola”—his most successful
picture; taken from the scene in which the Duke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>asks the Jester to “sing again that antique song he
sang last night.” The artist served as his own
model for the Duke.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears probable that Rossetti and Miss Siddal
were engaged as early as 1853, though the relationship
was not openly avowed for a considerable
period, and did not terminate in marriage
until 1860. Rossetti’s pecuniary position, at the
outset of his career, was naturally uncertain; nor
did it materially improve with subsequent prosperity
and fame; for his tastes and habits, according
to the traditions of artistic Bohemia, were as
luxurious and improvident as his earnings were
precarious. Miss Siddal, too, was delicate in
health. An early sketch of her, from Rossetti’s
hand, and now in the South Kensington Museum,
representing her as she stands by a window, in a
gown of quaint simplicity and soberness, gives perhaps
the truest impression of her personality that
could be selected from the portraits of that period.
The artless and yet somewhat austere pose, the
fragile grace and slightly languid sweetness of
aspect, afford a key to the criticism once passed to
the effect that “she would have been a Puritan if
she had not been an invalid.” The latter she
never was in the sense of chronic inactivity, but of
such delicacy as to give a peculiar tenderness to
her service as a model, and unhappily both to delay
and abbreviate the short period of married life.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>To some critics it has been a source of regret
that Rossetti should have come in youth so unreservedly
under the spell of a type of beauty as exclusive
as that of this well-beloved model. The
rare blending of spiritual with sensuous charm
which she presented in feature and expression so
fully satisfied his own ideal of that harmony as to
make him dwell upon, and perhaps specialize it, in
a way which constituted a danger to his art; inducing
him to read into other feminine types the
individual characteristics of the one. Fortunate
as he was in after life in obtaining for his models
some of the most beautiful and cultured women in
the artistic and literary circles of London, his tendency
was almost always to look at them, as it
were, in the light of that established ideal, and to
conceive them as versions merely of that elemental
loveliness which so dominated his thought. But it
was inevitable that a temperament like Rossetti’s
should specialize, through their very intensity, the
dominant characteristics most familiar to his pencil
and his brush. The case of Miss Herbert, an
accomplished actress who gave him a number of
sittings in the next decade, is perhaps the most
striking exception to the rule; but her style of
beauty was in too complete a contrast to that of
Miss Siddal (being of a severe, robust, and Hellenic
type) to allow of any compromise between the
features of the two.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The combined influence of Browning and
Tennyson among contemporary poets, and the
increasing sway of Dante over the young painter,
inclining him the more strongly in the direction of
historic romance, produced, as we have seen, a
somewhat desultory course of pen-and-ink sketches
and water-colour studies during the next few
years. The interval from 1850 to 1858 may be
reckoned as Rossetti’s second period. After the
completion of “Ecce Ancilla Domini,” he painted
no important oil picture until the Llandaff “Triptych”
of 1859, and the contemporary “Bocca
Baciata,” which stands first in point of time, and
high in point of merit, among the masterpieces of
his maturity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the water-colours of the second period,
capricious and experimental in treatment as many
of them are, include some of the most valuable,
because the most characteristic and significant, of
Rossetti’s work in the realm of pure romance. In
these rough and often hasty sketches, sometimes
less than twelve by twenty inches in size, his
imagination seems to have been exercising itself
upon the poetic subjects that haunted him by
turns with the vividness of actual life, more vital
and urgent than the realities of every day. Several,
indeed, of the finest of these water-colours are now
dated, on good authority, as early as 1848–49;
such as the lovely little sepia sketch, “The Sun
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>may Shine and we be cold,” given to his friend,
Alexander Monro, a young Scottish sculptor of
high promise, whose early death from consumption
removed an artist who could ill be spared
from the small and never very strong sculpture-branch
of the Pre-Raphaelite movement. To this
period also belong some of the most important of
the Dante subjects. From 1849 is dated “A
Parable of Love,” one of the best of Rossetti’s
early drawings in pen and ink. The lady is seated
at an easel on which she has been painting her
own portrait from a mirror at her side. Her lover,
bending over her from behind, lays his hand upon
hers to guide the brush anew. Mr. Woolner
served as the model for the lover. A pen-drawing
from Browning’s “Sordello,” entitled “Taurello’s
First Sight of Fortune,” also belongs to 1849,
together with the powerful little sketch, “The
Laboratory,” from the same poet, showing a
strange, brilliant, witch-like or almost serpent-like
woman in an alchemist’s shop, procuring from him
some fateful elixir wherewith to play upon her rival
and avenge herself upon the lover, once her own.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most beautiful water-colours of 1850
is the “Morning Music;” a dainty little half-length
figure of a white-clad girl seated at her
toilet, another maiden brushing her long bright
hair, while her lover stands, making music from
some archaic instrument, at her side. At this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>time also Rossetti made the first sketch of a subject
which fascinated him with peculiar force almost
throughout his artistic career, and to which he
returned again and again in several media, even
within a short time of his death, but without ever
achieving a finished picture—“Michael Scott’s
Wooing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1851 were made the best of several water-colour
drawings from the subject of “Lucretia
Borgia,” and the first pen and pencil sketches of a
subject suggested by the famous Döppelgänger
legends of northern Europe. The design for
“How they met themselves” remains among the
very highest of Rossetti’s conceptions in pure
romance. The final pen-and-ink version was not
done till 1860, nor the water-colour till 1864. The
subject demands further study in a separate chapter,
together with the principal Dante sketches in this
group. Several drawings from Shakespearean
subjects, including “Benedick and Beatrice” (“Much
Ado about Nothing”) and “Orlando and Adam in
the Forest” (“As You Like It”), were also
executed about this time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. F.G. Stephens traces some interesting
modifications of Rossetti’s technique between the
years 1850 and 1853 to the influence of his comrades
in the course of associated work. From
Millais he seems to have gained something of the
easy grace and suavity of style which was lacking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>in his first too strenuous work; from Holman
Hunt, the scrupulous and laboured detail which
readily became as exhaustively (and sometimes
exhaustingly) symbolic as Hunt’s own; and from
Ford Madox Brown a certain robust breadth and
dramatic mastery which was needed to lift his
subjective creations into a large and quickening
atmosphere. Probably it was the influence of
Madox Brown that led him to the field of stern
and practical social problems, of everyday romance;
to deal with the eternally crucial relationship of
frail womanhood to passionate manhood, and all
its sweet and bitter and profound significance upon
the life of humanity, as he dealt with it in the
wonderful “Hesterna Rosa” (“Yesterday’s Rose”)
of 1851, in “The Gate of Memory” six years
later, and in the great realistic picture, “Found,”
which was begun in 1852, but which, after many
vicissitudes of neglect, spasmodic effort, and frequent
despair, remained still unfinished at the
painter’s death. It may be wished that Rossetti
had pursued more thoroughly the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>motif</em></span> which thus
yielded some of the most remarkable and suggestive
of his designs. This group, however, again
affords a subject for consideration on a future page.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the year 1853 saw also the first outward
signs of the breaking-up of the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood. Thomas Woolner, the oldest member
of the Brotherhood, at this time twenty-eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>years of age, being still unable to earn a living in
London by his art, now determined to emigrate to
Australia, where some friends of his family were
already established at Melbourne, and to try his
luck at the gold-diggings, which were at that time
a source of much excitement and speculation in
English circles. Woolner had already achieved
some unpretentious but exceedingly thoughtful
and conscientious work in sculpture, but he had
not met with much academic recognition, nor with
any substantial favour from the art-patronising
public. For many years a pupil of Behnes, he
entered the Academy Schools in 1842, and contributed
a large composition of life-size figures
representing “The Death of Boadicea” to the
Westminster Cartoon Competition of 1844. His
contributions to the Royal Academy exhibitions in
Trafalgar Square had included “Eleanor Sucking
the Poison from the Wound of Prince Edward”
(1843), “Alastor” (from Shelley, 1846), “Feeding
the Hungry” (bas-relief, 1847), “Eros and Euphrosyne”
and “The Rainbow” (1848), and
portraits of Carlyle and Tennyson. At the British
Institution he had also exhibited a statuette of
“Puck” (1847) and “Titania Caressing the Indian
Boy” (1848). He sailed for Australia in the
spring of 1853, accompanied by a promising young
sculptor named Bernhard Smith (who died somewhat
prematurely in 1885), and followed shortly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>afterwards by E.L. Bateman, another close
sympathizer with Pre-Raphaelite aims. Woolner
returned to England early in 1857, and then
executed the fine bust of Tennyson recently placed
in Poets’ Corner, Westminster Abbey. His later
work, however, can hardly be classed with that
of the Pre-Raphaelite band. He died on the 7th
of October, 1892.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the summer of the same year the Brethren
agreed to paint together a group of their own
portraits, in order to send them over as a gift to
their distant comrade on the gold-fields of the
Antipodes. Accordingly, they met one day at
Millais’s studio in Gower Street. There were
present Dante and W.M. Rossetti, F.G. Stephens,
Millais, and Holman Hunt. Mr. W.M. Rossetti,
ranks the results in the following order of merit:—The
portrait of Stephens by Millais, of Millais by
Hunt, of W.M. Rossetti by Millais, of Dante
Rossetti by Hunt, and of Hunt by Dante Rossetti.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rossetti himself, as we have already seen, produced
but very few male portraits. The large
oil-painting of his godfather, Mr. Charles Lyell,
and the pencil drawings of his father and grandfather;
the water-colour sketches of Browning and
Swinburne, and the admirable life-size chalks of
Mr. Ruskin, Mr. Theodore Watts (said by Mr.
Swinburne to be his masterpiece in portraiture),
Mr. F.R. Leyland, Dr. Gordon Hake, Mr. George
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Hake, and Mr. W.J. Stillman, two or three pencil
drawings of Madox Brown, and the painting of
Holman Hunt, as above recorded, seem to exhaust
the list of his efforts in that field, if we exclude
the consideration of many excellent likenesses
which occur among his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>genre</em></span>-pictures. W.M.
Rossetti, for instance, sat more than once to his
brother for the head of Dante, and many other
important figures; in fact, there was a general
practice of mutual accommodation among the
Brothers in serving as models one to another.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the immense influence of the Pre-Raphaelite
movement upon English portraiture in the latter
half of the nineteenth century would be difficult to
over-estimate. It must be remembered that the
first principle of Pre-Raphaelitism—namely, that
nature, including human nature, is to be painted
truthfully and unflinchingly as it presents itself to
the painter’s eye—strikes directly at the root of the
conventional habit, which aimed at “idealizing”
the subject into something far superior to the
present reality. Still, as “the eye sees what it
brings the power to see,” so the rightly-trained
artist sees infinitely more than the casual observer,
and his purest realism becomes the highest ideality.
For in order to represent nature truly, something
more is demanded than imitation. Diderot tells
a story of a painter well known to him and to
fame, who, on beginning work upon a new subject,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>always went down upon his knees and prayed to
be delivered from the model. There was a grain
of truth in his notion. To be delivered from the
letter in order to apprehend the spirit, yet to follow
faithfully the visible in order to attain the invisible,
is the task of the portrait-painter. The mistake
of the pseudo-classic idealists, as of the impractical
folk in other walks of life, is to suppose that by
aiming at the spirit they are absolved from the
letter altogether; not perceiving that to gain the
spirit they must reach <em>through</em> the letter, and
<em>beyond</em> it. Every true portrait-painter is an idealist
in this highest sense, that he perceives and reproduces
the inmost and essential Self of his sitter,
and in supreme moments resolves, as Spinoza
would have it, the “potential human” into the
“actual divine.” He portrays scrupulously the
outward aspect, but interprets the whole by that
pervading spirit from within to which the outward
aspect has given him—as a seer—the key. The
face he paints is not transfigured by his own
imagination, his own conceit, however fair, of
what that face might or ought to be; but it is
revealed in its own distinct and actual being by a
witness which, if truthful, must be as generous as
stern. It is the immortal and inevitable “Thou
Thyself” of which Rossetti sings:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I am Thyself—what hast thou done to me?</div>
      <div class='line'>—And Thou Thyself to all eternity!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Yet if we may risk a paradox, it is precisely in the
<em>reality</em> that there lies the <em>potentiality</em> of the life
within; behind the physical <em>is</em> abides the spiritual
<em>may be</em>; the “everlasting no” of the uncompromising
realist, sifting, limiting, and analyzing down
the human unit into bare and rigid matter, often
conceals the hidden hope and promise of the
idealist’s “everlasting yea.” Hence a great portrait
is charged to the full with latent possibilities
of character and destiny. It suggests forces as
well as phenomena, causes as well as effects, inherent
tendencies as well as facts. Someone has
said that a human face should be either a promise
or a history. The definition is too narrow. Every
face, save perhaps in childhood, and not always
with that exception, contains both promise and
history inextricably blended each with each. A
great portrait must be passionately personal, intensely
individual; presenting one single, complete,
and separate identity to the eye and mind, and yet
in a very real sense <em>im</em>personal, having a certain
universal, humanitarian significance. For the
artist’s hand sets the human unit in its place in
the great Family; lifts it on to the broad planes of
the world’s common life. As his eye sees all things,
like Spinoza, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>sub specie eternitatis</em></span>—sees Time in
the light of Eternity—so it sees one Man in the
light of Humanity. He knows no isolations of
being, conceives no man as “living to himself;”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>but is concerned ever with relationships and imperative
sympathies between the subject of his
portrait and the rest of mankind; so that the
personality that looks forth from his canvas, faithfully
and profoundly interpreted by his own, has in
it the elements of appeal and challenge, and sends
out a radiance of vitality to its spiritual kin.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this ideal of portraiture the young Pre-Raphaelites
had been confirmed by Ruskin long
ago; and he had pointed them to the incomparable
portraits of Dante by Giotto, of Petrarch by Simon
Memmi, and of Savonarola by Fra Bartolomeo,
as examples among the Italian Pre-Raphaelites of
the attainment of such success. Rossetti and his
comrades in their turn, more especially some of the
younger and more independent spirits not actually
or permanently connected with the Brotherhood,
developed and perfected the ideal to a degree
incalculably fruitful in contemporary art. It will
hardly be disputed that in Mr. G.F. Watts, one of
the truest Pre-Raphaelites in aspiration and temper,
though utterly distinct from them in original genius
and intellectual range, England has found at last
her greatest portrait painter, while to Millais, one
of the original members of the Brotherhood, the
judgment of posterity will attribute a scarcely less
exalted place. They found the art of portraiture
degraded, almost without exception, to the lowest
level of trivial prettiness as regards women, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>vulgar affectation in dealing with men. “The
system to be overthrown,” as Ruskin said, “was
one of which the main characteristic was the pursuit
of beauty at the expense of truth.” And such
pursuit leads in all ages to the same inexorable
fatality,—the beauty so gained is always of a
false and spurious kind. The ancient allegory of
Pandemos and Urania is for ever true in art. The
seeker for ideal beauty seeks it only in visible
forms, pursues it through the physical world alone,
awaits it at the doors of sense merely, and is
straightway ensnared by the earthly Pandemos,
the Venus of the flesh. But let him steadfastly
set his soul to the higher worship, let him seek
reverently the moral and spiritual loveliness of
human character in the great <em>is</em> and the greater
<em>may be</em> of the throbbing, actual life around him,
and surely he will be brought into the near presence
of the heavenly Urania; surely he will pass, with
Rossetti, through “Body’s Beauty” to “Soul’s
Beauty,” and worship with him</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>—“that Lady Beauty in whose praise</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thy voice and hand shake still,—long known to thee</div>
      <div class='line in4'>By flying hair and fluttering hem,—the beat</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Following her daily of thy heart and feet,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How passionately and irretrievably,</div>
      <div class='line'>In what fond flight, how many ways and days!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The attention of Mr. Ruskin had meanwhile
been diverted to some extent from the work of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Millais and Hunt by his entrance in 1854 upon a
close personal friendship with Rossetti, which lasted
in cordial fidelity for some ten or twelve years. At
the time of his first public championship of the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood, Mr. Ruskin had known
nothing of Rossetti’s work, inasmuch as it had
never yet appeared on the walls of the Academy
or in any of the popular exhibitions of the period.
But, for such unintentional and unconscious neglect
of the real leader of the movement which he so
warmly endorsed, the great critic now made ample
reparation. He became a constant and generous
patron of Rossetti’s pictures until the painter passed,
about the year 1865, into his third artistic period,
and developed methods less in accordance with
Ruskin’s especial tenets. That the gradual severance
of intimacy between artist and buyer should
have been brought about by the former’s independence
of spirit and resolute adherence to his own
inspirations and aims, in the face of some, perhaps,
over-officious criticism and counsel from his patron,
is certainly no discredit to Rossetti. At the same
time, the art-world owes a debt of gratitude to
Mr. Ruskin for having so long encouraged, by his
support and sympathy, the production of those exquisite
water-colours which Rossetti, unsettled as
he then was in habits of painting, might not otherwise
have accomplished in such splendour and
cogency during his transition period.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>And to these years of intimacy with Ruskin belong
nearly all the finest drawings of his “Morte
D’Arthur” series, such as “King Arthur’s Tomb”
(called sometimes “The Last Meeting of Launcelot
and Guinevere,” though the design by no means
gives the impression of a meeting in the flesh),
“The Damozel of the Sanct Grael,” “The Chapel
before the Lists,” “The Meeting of Sir Tristram
and Iseult,” “Sir Galahad in the Ruined Chapel,”
“Sir Galahad and Sir Bors,” “Launcelot Escaping
from Guinevere’s Chamber,” and “The Death of
Breuse sans Pitié;” together with a fresh and important
group of Biblical subjects treated in a more
daringly romantic manner than before, including
“The Passover in the Holy Family,” “Bethlehem
Gate,” “Ruth and Boaz,” “The Crucifixion,” “Mary
in the House of John,” and the first sketch for
“Mary Magdalene at the Door of Simon the
Pharisee;” also the “Triptych” for the altar-piece
of Llandaff Cathedral, “The Infant Christ Adored
by a Shepherd and a King.” The Dante subjects
again appear in 1854–55, with “Francesca di
Rimini,” “Paolo and Francesca,” “Matilda Gathering
Flowers” (from the “Purgatorio”), “Dante’s
Vision of Rachel and Leah,” “Dante at Verona,”
and the first version of the picture afterwards
among Rossetti’s masterpieces, “Dante’s Dream.”
The little drawings of “The Tune of the Seven
Towers” in 1850, “Carlisle Tower,” “Fra Angelico
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Painting,” and “Giorgione Painting” in
1853, “The Queen’s Page” (from Heine) in 1854,
“Fra Pace” and “Monna Rosa” in 1856, “The
Blue Closet,” “The Blue Bower,” “The Bower
Garden,” and the first design for a favourite subject
variously known as “Aurelia” and “Bonifazio’s”
or “Fazio’s Mistress” in 1857; these, together
with some further sketches for “La Belle Dame
sans Merci,” a number of portraits of Miss Siddal,
Browning, Tennyson, and Swinburne, whom he
knew in 1857, are but a selection from the almost
countless studies, in pencil, pen and ink, neutral
tint, water-colour, and occasional oil, scattered
over Rossetti’s transition period.</p>

<p class='c005'>“St. Luke the Painter,” in 1857, is notable as
being Rossetti’s first success in coloured chalk; a
medium which he affected more freely in after
years, and with extraordinary power and felicity;
the medium, in fact, in which some of the noblest
of his later half-length symbolic figures were
executed.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the year 1850 Rossetti almost ceased to
exhibit in picture galleries. A very few of his
pictures, including the “Bocca Baciata” and a
version of “Lucretia Borgia,” were thenceforth
seen in the Hogarth Club, a small society of
artists and amateurs to which he belonged, and
others afterwards in the Arundel Club, which he
joined in 1865. An important exception, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>was made to this rule of seclusion in 1856,
when a small but highly representative Pre-Raphaelite
Exhibition was opened at 4, Russell
Place, Fitzroy Square. Among Rossetti’s contributions
were the first water-colour draft of
“Dante’s Dream,” already alluded to, and its
pendant, “The Anniversary of the Death of
Beatrice,” “Hesterna Rosa,” “The Blue Closet,”
and “Mary Magdalene.” The other exhibitors
were Millais, Holman Hunt, Madox Brown,
Arthur Hughes, Charles Collins, William Davis,
W.L. Windus, Inchbold, Seddon and Brett.
The “Dante’s Dream” re-appeared at the Liverpool
Academy in 1858, together with “A Christmas
Carol,” and “The Wedding of St. George”;
“Fair Rosamund,” and “The Farmer’s Daughter”
(study for “Found”) went to the Royal Scottish
Academy in 1862; and “Mary in the House of
John” appeared at the Fine Art Society’s Galleries
in 1879. A version of “Pandora,” in 1877
or 1878, and a lovely little water-colour, “Spring,”
in 1879, were lent by their purchasers to the
Glasgow Institute of Fine Arts; “Tibullus’s Return
to Delia” was similarly lent to the Albert
Gallery Exhibition at Edinburgh in 1877; and in
1881 the Loan Exhibition at the Royal Manchester
Institution included four important water-colours—“Proserpine,”
a “Lucretia Borgia,”
“Hesterna Rosa,” and “Washing Hands;” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>five oils—“Proserpine,” “Two Mothers,” “Joli
C&oelig;ur,” “A Vision of Fiametta,” and “Water-Willow.”
These instances complete the brief list
of Rossetti’s pictures exhibited in public galleries
during the lifetime of the artist.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the year 1854, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood,
already practically broken up by divergence
of method in the leading painters, and changes of
aim and sphere among the lesser lights of the
revolutionary dawn, may be said to have been
finally dispersed by the lamented death of Walter
Deverell, and the departure of Holman Hunt for
a lengthy sojourn in the East, there to paint
directly from nature—according to the much
boasted but oft-broken rule—the backgrounds
and appurtenances of those Biblical subjects to
which he was now strongly drawn. The death of
Deverell at an early age was a heavy personal
bereavement to Rossetti, and an occasion of
genuine grief to all the Brotherhood, with whom
he was exceedingly popular. Nor was the loss to
art easily reparable, or the work of his surviving
comrades unaffected by the removal of a painter
of such singular purity and grace. He was a son
of the Secretary of the Schools of Design, which
were the precursor of the South Kensington
Science and Art Department.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rossetti and Millais were thus, in 1854, left
alone as practical painters; W.M. Rossetti
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>having been from the first exclusively a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>littérateur</em></span>,
while F.G. Stephens, after having produced
in youth some work of high quality on strictly
Pre-Raphaelite lines, had by this time adopted
the same sphere of energy, especially in the realm
of the art-critic.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the phase of doubt and hesitation, of compromise
(in no invidious sense) between the first
inflexible attitude of revolt and the further impulse
of re-construction, which had overtaken the
Brotherhood in 1851, was by no means the special
ordeal of Rossetti. It came soon afterwards upon
Millais with an equal import and significance; as
though each must pass, in individual experience,
through the several stages of destructive and re-creative
energy, first of protest, then of reform,
and afterwards of reconciliation and progress,
which they had recognized in the history of the
past, and which their own work as a whole
afforded to the history of the nineteenth century.
They had to exemplify, each for himself, the
resolute overthrow of partial and degenerate
principles, and the pursuit, more or less successful,
of a further and perhaps undefined ideal, or the
reaction towards that very order against which
their own strenuous protest had been set. And
it is remarkable that, in the case both of Rossetti
and of Millais, the painter should have reached
his highest level of excellence in art precisely at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the moment when his methods were the most unsettled
and his principles the least assured. The
most discerning critics now agree in placing the
high-water mark of Rossetti’s genius in the midst
of this transition period, ranging from 1850 to
1860, or, if the decade may be stretched by a
license of etymology, covering the “Beata Beatrix”
of 1863. And it is scarcely disputable that
the supreme achievements of Millais lie within a
narrower space, comprising chiefly the “Hugenot”
and “Ophelia” of 1852, “The Order of Release”
of 1853, “Autumn Leaves” and “The
Blind Girl” of 1856, and “The Eve of St.
Agnes” in 1863, which really belongs in conception
and spirit to the Keats epoch, if we may so
call it, which gave birth to the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood. Just as in the dawn of the Italian
Renaissance the point of absolute greatness in art
was gained at the momentary coalition of the old
forces with the new, when the classic spirit was
conquered and absorbed by the spirit of romance,
and the romantic spirit still beat tremulously
about the new world’s doors, so in the struggle of
the modern Pre-Raphaelites to reconcile the new
impulse with the heritage of the past, the triumph
came in the midst of the conflict rather than after
the victory. Just as Leonardo and Michaelangelo
gathered up and combined the discordant elements
of the strife around them into a noble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>harmony of art, so did the Pre-Raphaelites attune
and interpret the diverse forces of their own revolution
when they felt its import most acutely,
and least knew whither it would lead them. And
to almost opposite poles of thought and sentiment
were Millais and Rossetti led.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extraordinary change which gradually
came over the work of Millais after his election
to the Associateship of the Royal Academy in
1854—the youngest painter, with the exception of
Lawrence, ever admitted to that rank—has been
the subject of much criticism and controversy. It
has been contended by several writers that Millais
lacked original imagination, and could not sustain
his early level without the constant inspiration
and stimulus of Rossetti and Hunt, both of whom
were by this time absorbed in fresh developments
of their own. More ardent apologists have
claimed that his Pre-Raphaelite period was but a
curious episode in Millais’s career; a mere incident
in the growth of a genius too brilliant to
submit for long to bias from without; and that
his impressionable nature was only temporarily
swayed by the proselytizing enthusiasm of his
comrades. It is hard to attribute the qualities of
his finest work—qualities of a high imaginative
order, as in “The Eve of St. Agnes,” or “The
Enemy Sowing Tares,” to any genius but his
own, or to believe that the painter of “Ophelia”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>and the “Blind Girl” was not himself profoundly
moved by the pathos and tragedy which he
therein conceived. Nor can it be urged that the
exigencies of ill-fortune, the stress of poverty, or
any of those dire necessities of fate which have
driven many a true artist on the downward road,
drove Millais to paint as unblushingly for the
Philistine market as he had formerly done for an
obscure and despised coterie of artistic revolutionists.
Free as he always was of pecuniary care,
and favoured by destiny with all the pleasures of
domestic and social prosperity, if he was spoilt,
it was by success, not failure; if corrupted, it was
by popularity, not neglect: though it must be
remembered that none of the Pre-Raphaelites
can justly pose as martyrs in the matter of a
livelihood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor is it permissible to urge that fame, at first
well earned and richly justified, entitles any great
painter to repudiate the convictions and ideals on
which that fame was built, or to play with a reputation
won at a heavy cost to himself and others.
It can only be assumed that Millais, in forsaking
the high and steep paths which he had once chosen,
sincerely followed what he felt to be a more excellent
way, and honestly believed his decadence to
be an advance upon his maturity. To doubt this
would be to pass the sternest moral condemnation
on an artist of incomparable endowments, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>brand him as the wanton betrayer of a sacred
trust, the deliberate concealer of a divine talent,
for which, at the ultimate judgment-seat of art, the
inevitable account must at last be given.</p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking of this turning-point in Millais’s career,
Mr. Ruskin said in 1857:—“The change in his
manner from the years of ‘Ophelia’ and ‘Mariana’
to 1857 is not merely Fall; it is Catastrophe; not
merely a loss of power, but a reversal of principle;
his excellence has been effaced ‘as a man wipeth a
dish—wiping it and turning it upside down.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Pre-Raphaelite movement, so far from
being at an end, was now only emerging from the
first tentative phase of its activity. It had yet to
be absorbed in a larger reformation, and to act
thereby even more potently than if it had remained
the specific crusade of a clique or faction. The
difficulty which the historian finds at this crisis in
the artistic career of Rossetti and his friends, and
still more so in their subsequent developments,—the
difficulty of defining strictly Pre-Raphaelite
work, and of deciding as to who of the now rapidly
expanding circle of painters may justly be claimed
as Pre-Raphaelites, is itself evidence of the permeating
force of the initial movement, and of the
ready soil which was prepared for the dissemination
of its dominant ideas. For the circle of
literary and artistic aspirants, patrons, students,
amateurs, and connoisseurs of many grades and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>varied gifts who now surrounded Dante Rossetti,
included men whose names afterwards became
honoured in fields of art quite untouched by Pre-Raphaelitism
in its distinctive form, but imbued
through their influence with fresh and quickening
impulses of revival.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most poetic of the painters intimately
associated with the Brotherhood was Arthur
Hughes, who, though only eighteen at the time of
its formation, took an active share in its practical
work, and painted, according to its main tenets,
with a rare facility and tender charm. He was
born in London in 1832, passed through the
Academy Schools without much recognition, but
won cordial admiration among the limited company
who could then appreciate his work, by
his beautiful “April Love” in the Academy of
1854. He was also singularly successful at a
later date in a subject from Keats’s “Eve of St.
Agnes”—the source of inspiration for some of the
finest work of the Pre-Raphaelite leaders at various
times. Like Millais and several others of the
band, he attained considerable popularity as an
illustrator of books. His religious paintings,
moreover, will demand attention among those of
his more illustrious friends. “The Cottager’s
Return” and “The Reaper and the Flowers”
may be remembered, among others of his always
graceful pictures, by those who recall the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>decade of Pre-Raphaelite propaganda in public
exhibitions. He sat as the model for the hero in
Millais’s “Proscribed Royalist” of 1853.</p>

<p class='c000'>Charles Allston Collins, a son of William
Collins, R.A., and brother of Wilkie Collins,
painted for some time in the manner of the
Pre-Raphaelites, but subsequently devoted himself
to literature. His first exhibited picture,
“Convent Thoughts,” in the Academy of 1850,
shared with Millais’s “Christ in the House of
His Parents,” the torrent of opprobrium showered
on the innovators in that eventful year. Yet three
of his works were accepted by the Academy the
following season,—“Lyra Innocentium,” on a verse
from Keble; representing a young girl in a white
gown against a background of blue; “May in the
Regent’s Park,” a wonderfully minute study of
foliage, as if seen through a window opening close
upon the trees; and “The Devout Childhood of
Saint Elizabeth of Hungary,” calling to mind the
treatment by James Collinson of the familiar renunciation-legend
anent the same much-maligned
saint. The Elizabeth of the “Childhood” is depicted
as a homely-looking little girl of thirteen,
kneeling at the iron-barred oaken door of a chapel
in the Palace grounds. Her missal is laid on the
doorstep beside her, and she is imagined, according
to the account of her early piety, to be at prayer
on the inhospitable threshold of the shrine to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>which she cannot for the moment gain access.
Charles Collins acted as Millais’s model for “The
Hugenot” and “The Black Brunswicker.” He
married a daughter of Charles Dickens, who posed
with him as the lady in the “Hugenot.”</p>

<p class='c000'>William L. Windus, a Liverpool artist and
member of the Academy of that city, made his
modest but genuine fame chiefly through his powerful
romantic picture of “Burd Helen,” the “burd”
or sweetheart of the Scottish border ballad, who
swam the Clyde in order to avenge herself upon
a faithless lover. The work was pronounced by
Ruskin to rank second only in order of merit to
Millais’s “Autumn Leaves” in the Royal Academy
of 1856. He painted altogether some eight or ten
pictures of a very earnest and imaginative kind, of
which one of the finest was entitled “Too Late,”
and represented a dying girl whose lover had forsaken
her and returned too late for reparation.
“The Surgeon’s Daughter” is also remembered
as a composition of much chastened and subdued
power. Windus ceased painting at an early age,
and was lost sight of by the Brotherhood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Robert B. Martineau was a pupil of Holman
Hunt, but painted, among some three or four
pictures which constitute the brief total of his
achievements, only one of striking merit,—“The
Last Day in the Old Home,” which for sincerity
and depth of feeling won considerable appreciation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>in 1865. His career was cut short by untimely
death soon afterwards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cave Thomas, who so infelicitously christened
“The Germ,” had gained a prize in the Westminster
Cartoon competition, and was the painter
of one very beautiful picture, “The Protestant
Lady,” exhibited in the Academy, and greatly
admired by the Brotherhood. He published in
1860 a monograph entitled “Pre-Raphaelitism
Tested by the Principles of Christianity;” and
subsequently became art professor to the Princess
of Wales.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Frederick Sandys was not personally known
to the leading Pre-Raphaelites until 1857, and was
by that time too original and accomplished an
artist to be claimed by them as a disciple, but
his work was for some time intimately associated
with theirs. He was to the last a valued friend
of Rossetti, who always affirmed that while in
draughtsmanship he had no superior in English
art, his imaginative endowment was of the richest
and rarest kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Henry Wallis is justly remembered by his
one great picture, “The Death of Chatterton,”
which touched popular feeling as its true pathos
and dignity deserved to do, and won universal
praise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mark Anthony is rightly regarded by the Pre-Raphaelites
as the most poetic of their landscape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>painters. His grandly simple and reposeful “Old
Churchyard” will compare even with Millais’s
“Vale of Rest,” and his “Nature’s Mirror” with
Mr. Burne-Jones’s “Mirror of Venus” in later
years. Mr. John Brett, now famous in seascape,
was for some time intimate with the Brotherhood;
and among friends and sympathizers on a similar
footing may be mentioned Val Prinsep, Thomas
Seddon, J.D. Watson, J.F. Lewes, W.S. Burton,
Spencer Stanhope, M.F. Halliday, James Campbell,
J.M. Carrick, Thomas Morten, Edward Lear,
William Davis, W.P. Boyce, J.W. Inchbold, and,
by no means least, John Hancock, a young sculptor
who won an Art Union prize in 1848 with a bas-relief
of “Christ’s Entry into Jerusalem.” He was
a friend and fellow-worker with Woolner, and fell
so far (with Rossetti) under the fascination of the
Dante legends as to accomplish a very fine statue
of “Beatrice” in or about 1852. One other artist
of the first rank in his generation remains to
be named,—Frederick Shields, an intimate and
warmly-loved friend of Rossetti, cherished by him
in close and unbroken companionship even to the
hour of death; and in point of critical estimate
pronounced by him to be one of the greatest of
living draughtsmen, taking rank with Sir Frederick
Leighton, Sir Noel Paton, and Mr. Sandys.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such were a few of the personalities that gathered
between 1848 and 1858 around the three prime
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>movers in the Pre-Raphaelite revolt. To claim
them as merely, or chiefly, satellites drawn into the
orbit of genius, or as forming a distinct and coherent
school, would be both foolish and unjust.
To attempt an estimate of their relative merit independent
of, or in proportion to, the artistic work
of the Brotherhood, would be no less invidious than
unprofitable. The glory of Pre-Raphaelitism was
that it gave the utmost play to individual methods,
and even idiosyncrasies,—nay, that its very first
principle was “each for himself”—painting his
own impressions, his own ideals—and no imitation
of one artist by another. Its primary insistence
lay on the watchword of all Protestantism—the
authority of the individual conscience as against
that of a class or a system, and the immediate
access for every soul to the source of its highest
inspiration. Therefore the “diversities of gifts”
which flourished and increased under the sway of
the Pre-Raphaelite spirit were the best evidence
of that spirit’s quickening power. “A man will
always emphasize,” says Mr. P.G. Hamerton,
writing on the ultimate effects of the movement,
“those truths about art which most strongly recommend
themselves to his own peculiar personal
temperament. This comes from the vastness of
art and the variety of human organizations. For
art is so immense a study that no one man ever
knew the whole truth about it.” In other words,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>all the Pre-Raphaelite painters in any sense worthy
of the name are intensely individual in quality, and
cannot be classed, arranged, or compared together
in the order of a system or a school. Each artist
must make his original and distinctive contribution
to the sum-total of artistic truth; must paint the
single aspect, or the most familiar aspect, of the
life around him which presents itself to his mind.
The more honest he is, and the more true to his
own observations and convictions, the more inevitably
will he see the world through his own
spectacles—well for his superficial happiness, at
all events, if they be rose-coloured, and not of a
more sombre hue. “We all,” says another art-critic,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
“have a sense of some particular colour, and
because we can paint this colour best we do so at
all times and in all places. This may be unconscious
on our part—this predilection for a particular
colour; but we all unconsciously blab the
fact to others; we talk in our dream of art, and tell
all our secrets. Old David Cox, when out sketching
with his pupils, would go behind them while at
work and say to one, ‘Ah, you see green;’ to
another, ‘You see purple,’ ‘You see red,’ <a id='corr131'></a><ins class='correction' title='You'>‘You</ins>
see yellow.’  So it is with the colour vision of
many who are called Masters. We can identify
almost any landscape of our more prominent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>painters by their special idiosyncrasy of colouring,
such as Cuyp with his evening yellows, Linnell
with his autumnal browns, or Danby with his
sanguinary sunsets. These colours, which are
exceptional with external nature, are the rule with
them. Not only is this so with regard to colour,
but, more or less, we put ourselves, form and
feature, into our work, and paint our own character,
physical as well as mental, in all we do. Raphael,
on being asked where he obtained the type of his
Madonna, replied, ‘out of his own head,’ which
really meant that he had unconsciously painted
his own fair features: and this ideal was what he
eternally repeated. So was it with Michaelangelo,
Leonardo, Murillo, Rubens, Vandyke—they all
portrayed themselves recognizably. There is a
picture of Jesus and the twelve Apostles in which
the whole thirteen faces are all alike, and every
one an identifiable copy of the painter’s own. Of
course where the face and form are noble we have
the less to object to.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This indeed is the crux of the whole matter.
As the man is, so will his work be. To portray
one’s very self—and first to have such a self as can
dignify the portrayal; to paint faithfully what one
sees—and first to see the true and the beautiful in
the familiar and the commonplace; to depict the
world in which one lives—living in a world apart,
noble and fair, full of opportunities, if also of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>mysteries, with bright horizons, however low the
sun; and yet to be ever conscious of wider worlds
than the imagination can compass though the heart
may yearn over them like the heart of him who
said <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Homo sum; nihil humana mihi alienum puto</em></span>:
this is fine art; this is “the vision and the faculty
divine.” “Produce great Persons!” cries Browning,—“the
rest follows.” Therefore it is safe for
those who in any real sense know Rossetti to
prophesy, with Mr. Harry Quilter, that “the day
will surely come when it will be seen that the
essence of what is now known as Pre-Raphaelitism
was not the influence of a school or a principle, but
simply the influence of one man, and that man
Dante Gabriel Rossetti.” Personal ascendency,
says Emerson, is the only force much worth
reckoning with. And if that ascendency, over
many who never saw Rossetti on earth, has become
an intimate and precious inspiration, a motive-impulse
abidingly sacred and high, what must it
have been to those who knew him in the flesh?</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. W.M. Rossetti thus succinctly sums up the
immediate issue of the movement which his brother
inspired:—“As it turned out, the early phases of
the movement did not repeat themselves on a more
extended scale. Partly, no doubt, through the
modification of style of the most popular Pre-Raphaelite,
Mr. Millais, and partly through the
influx of new determining conditions, especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>the effect of foreign schools and of Mr. Leighton’s
style (this was written in 1865), Pre-Raphaelitism
flagged in its influence towards the production of
what are distinctively termed Pre-Raphaelite pictures
just at the time when it had virtually won
the day. But the movement had broken up the
pre-existing state of things, and the principles and
practices which it introduced took strong root, and
germinated in forms not altogether expected. Pre-Raphaelitism
aimed at suppressing such styles of
painting as were exemplified by Messrs. Elmore,
Goodall, and Stone at the time of its starting;
<em>and it did suppress them</em>.”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The relation of Pre-Raphaelitism to the “foreign
schools” here referred to is as much a matter of
historical controversy as the relation of Rossetti to
Italy is of biographical criticism; nor is it easy to
determine how far the Pre-Raphaelite movement
in England was the effect or the cause of similar
waves of experiment in France and Germany, and
how far all such impulses were but the symptoms
of a great social and ethical development in
European life. But while the Barbizon School
must be seriously recognized as working side by
side with the Pre-Raphaelites upon kindred ideals,
and even surpassing them at some points in a
certain largeness of outlook on humanitarian
themes, the influence of Cornelius and Overbeck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>in Germany, with the very crude and sickly mediævalism
which they affected, has no doubt been
greatly overrated, and may be dismissed as having
very little to do with the main current of the
romantic revival. In France, Corot and Millet,
Daubigny and Rousseau, had taken their stand
against the old Heroic School in art, just as
Théophile Gautier and Victor Hugo had taken it
against the Academies of literature. In England,
it was the task of Rossetti and his comrades “to
force,” as it has been aptly expressed, “an artificial
art backed upon nature’s reality; and they did it
amid neglect, misunderstanding, and even coarse
vituperation.”</p>

Last Decade—Death at Birchington.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first and most fruitful decade of Pre-Raphaelitism
in painting and poetry saw
also the excursion of several of its leaders
into the realm of book-illustration. In 1855 Rossetti,
Millais, and Arthur Hughes combined to
make a series of drawings for the second edition
of a little volume of verse entitled “Day and Night
Songs,” by William Allingham, a young poet well
known to the Brotherhood since 1849. The efforts
were not of an ambitious character. The weird
little group of fairies dancing in the moonlight, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Arthur Hughes, reflected vividly the influence of
Blake. Rossetti’s “Maids of Elfinmere” were of
his most angelic-mediæval type, ascetically beautiful,
and yet, if the phrase may be permitted, with
a certain sensuous severity of look, a delicate and
half-mystic passion, as of pure spirits newly wakened
to the tenderness of the flesh.</p>

<p class='c000'>A more important experiment in the same direction
was made in 1857, when Rossetti, Millais, and
Holman Hunt appeared among the illustrators
of Moxon’s edition of “Tennyson.” Intimately
charmed as they had all been with the “Idylls of
the King,” and with such entirely “Pre-Raphaelite”
poetry as “The Lady of Shalott,” the draughtsmen
could hardly have found a more congenial sphere
for design. The volume affords one of the most
interesting records of the transitional work of the
three painters. Woolner’s fine medallion of the
young laureate formed the frontispiece. Then
followed Millais’s “Mariana”—a composition wholly
distinct from, and far inferior to, his “Mariana in
the Moated Grange,” which had been shown in
the Academy of 1851. The face of this Mariana
is hidden in her hands as she turns with bowed
head from the window, and from the sunset that
mocks her grief with its imperturbable glory heedless
and afar. Much less conventional in spirit
is the passionate, strained figure of Rossetti’s
“Mariana in the South,” crouching on her unrestful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>bed, and kissing the feet of the crucifix
above her as she draws from her bosom the “old
letters breathing of her worth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the design for “The Lady of Shalott”
Holman Hunt exhibits traces—very unusual for
him—of the influence of Rossetti upon his own
work. For pathetic dignity and sensuous grace,
the entangled lady, girt about with the web of
dreams, might well stand among Rossetti’s children,
and not be detected as of other birth. Rossetti’s
own “Lady of Shalott” is much less fair a type,
and belongs to the earliest and most archaic manner
of his Arthurian period. Much more characteristic
of the painter’s individuality is Holman Hunt’s
“Oriana,” a grave, strong woman like his later
Madonnas, whose mien belies the conventional sex-theory
which ascribes to man alone the “wisdom-principle,”
and assigns to womanhood the principle
of “love.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Rossetti, again, seems to have been largely influenced
by Madox Brown in his illustration to
“The Palace of Art,” save for the highly characteristic
drawing of the girl at the organ, whose
pose is almost identical with that of the dead
Beatrice in “Dante’s Dream,” of a much later
date. “Sir Galahad” is, however, entirely original
in manner, and represents the best level of Rossetti’s
Arthurian designs. It shows the knight
halting, weary but not dispirited, at a wayside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>shrine, and bending with worn and yet resolute
face over the holy water that awaits the pilgrim-worshippers.
His horse, bearing the white banner
marked with the red cross of sacred chivalry, stands
at the gate, and a group of nuns are seen within,
ringing the chapel bell.</p>

<p class='c000'>The facile simplicity and grace of Millais, who
was more accustomed to the task of book-illustration
than his collaborateurs, found favourable scope
in “Edward Grey” and “The Day-dream,” in
which the figure of the half-awakened girl in the
Sleeping Palace is drawn with exquisitely tender
charm.</p>

<p class='c000'>The edition, on the whole, probably tended to
increase the reputation of the Pre-Raphaelites as
draughtsmen, and to dispel some hard-dying illusions
as to their distinguishing qualities in design,
though its independent merits were not of exceptional
mark.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only once again does Rossetti appear in the
field of book illustration. In 1862 he executed
two designs for the first volume of poems published
by his sister, Miss Christina Rossetti, under the
title of “Goblin Market.” These drawings (“Buy
from us with a golden curl” and “Golden head by
Golden head”) were followed in 1866 by two more
of a similar character (“The long hours go and
come and go,” and “You should have wept her
yesterday”), to illustrate the second volume of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>poetry from the same pen, entitled, “The Prince’s
Progress.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the fame of the Pre-Raphaelites as poets
was already enhanced, within an increasing circle
of appreciators, by the publication, in 1856, of a
journal which may, to some extent, be regarded as
a successor to the “The Germ.” “The Oxford
and Cambridge Magazine,” edited by Mr. Godfrey
Lushington, had the better fortune to survive for
a year, in monthly numbers; though all its contents
were anonymous, and its issue involved no less
labour and anxiety on the part of its sponsors, if
not so much pecuniary onus as in the case of the
more luxuriously printed and illustrated “Germ.”
The new publication contained several of Rossetti’s
finest poems, such as “The Staff and Scrip,” and
“Nineveh,” and a series of mediæval romances
and poems by two young artists destined henceforth
to be intimately associated with the Pre-Raphaelite
movement, and to exert important influence
on its later developments—William Morris
and Edward Burne-Jones. Both were Oxford men,
and had been close friends at Exeter College,
whence in 1856 came Burne-Jones to London
with the express desire of meeting and knowing
Dante Rossetti, his senior by five years; he having
been born in Birmingham on the 28th of August,
1833, and educated at King Edward’s School in
that city, proceeding to Oxford in 1853.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>It was at the Working Men’s College in Great
Ormond Street that Burne-Jones first saw Rossetti,
and, through the introduction of Mr. Vernon Lushington,
entered upon the friendship which was to
save him (as his friend William Morris was similarly
saved) from adopting, as had been intended,
the Church as his profession, and thus depriving,
the world of a service no less religious in the
highest sense, and no less potent a factor in the
ethical awakening of to-day.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Working Men’s College, now rich in annals
of some of the most significant intellectual movements
of the mid-century, was at that time a centre
of enthusiastic work in art and literature. Rossetti
and his friends took a considerable share in the
lecturing and class-teaching of which Charles
Kingsley and F.D. Maurice were the popular and
indefatigable leaders. Hither also came Ruskin,
of whom Rossetti records with loyal admiration
how one night, being asked in an emergency to
address the drawing-class, he made, without any
preparation, “the finest speech I ever heard.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Rossetti’s growing intimacy with Oxford collegians,
and the ties of sympathy already formed
in Oxford round the Pre-Raphaelite painters by
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>clientèle</em></span> of Millais and Hunt, now led him into
an enterprise which has been the subject of much
Philistine mirth, and of some laboured apologetics
on the part of the too-serious historian. There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>no doubt that Rossetti and his collaborateurs made
quite as merry as any of their critics over the
ludicrous failure of their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>début</em></span> as fresco-painters in
1857. But it was very natural that Rossetti, with
his early enthusiasm for the fresco style yet
awaiting an outlet, should have seized eagerly at
the chance of trying his ’prentice hand on so
engagingly favourable an area as the new hall of
the Oxford Union Debating Society. Visiting the
city in company with William Morris during the
summer months, Rossetti was shown over the
freshly completed building by his friend Mr.
Woodward; and observing the blank spaces of the
gallery window-bays, impulsively offered to paint
on them a series of the “Morte D’Arthur” subjects
which had so much engrossed his fancy during the
past three years. The suggestion was readily
agreed to, and Rossetti began to collect recruits for
the campaign, which he perceived would afford
ample scope for other labour than his own.
Accordingly, at the commencement of the long
vacation, a company of six young enthusiasts,
embarrassingly ignorant of the first technical elements
of mural painting, but unabashed by any
such details in the path of success, fell confidently
upon their fascinating task. The party consisted
of Rossetti, Burne-Jones, William Morris, Arthur
Hughes, Val Prinsep, Spencer Stanhope, Alexander
Monro, and J. Hungerford Pollen, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Proctor at the University, who had already won
some distinction by his painting of the beautiful
roof in Merton College Chapel. The roof of the
Debating Hall was now successfully painted, in a
grotesque design, by William Morris, who also
undertook one of the window-bays, and proposed
as his subject “Sir Palomides’ Jealousy of Sir
Tristram and Iseult.” Alexander Monro, the
sculptor of the party, executed the stone shield
over the porch. Burne-Jones selected for his fresco
“Nimuë brings Sir Peleus to Ettarde after their
Quarrel;” Arthur Hughes proposed “Arthur
Conveyed by the Weeping Queens to Avalon after
his Death;” Val Prinsep, “Merlin Lured into the
Pit by the Lady of the Lake,” and J. Hungerford
Pollen, “King Arthur Receiving the Sword Excalibur
from the Lady of the Lake.” Rossetti’s
subjects were “Sir Galahad Receiving the Sangrael”
and “Sir Launcelot before the Shrine of
the Sangrael.” The knight, in this last design,
has just attained the sacred goal of his pilgrimage,
and in his weariness has sunk down in sleep upon
the threshold; but his sleep, even in that hour, is
haunted by the face of Guinevere. So powerful
was this composition in romantic force and imaginative
fervour, especially in the haunting, passionate
face of the Queen, as to make the speedy obliteration
of this and its companion frescoes the more
deplorable, in spite of the obvious crudities and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>incompetencies that blemish the whole series of
designs. Obliterated they became, however, and
hopelessly beyond restoration, within a very short
time of their commencement;—finished they never
were. Incredible as it seems, in these days of
superior wisdom in the Young Person anent
matters of Art, these brilliant young painters of
1857—three at least of them now in the first rank
of fame in their several spheres—had not even
attempted to prepare the raw brick surface for the
reception of their pigments, but had cast their
ordinary oil-colours direct upon the inhospitable wall.
Time and the atmosphere made short work of such
artless challenges of decay; and before any of the
frescoes had attained completion the ardent little
band were obliged to confess themselves defeated,
and to retire somewhat ignominiously from the
field. The enterprise had its pathetic, its humorous,
and its entirely delightful side. The financial
arrangement with the Oxford Union Council was
that they should defray all necessary expenses
incurred by the artists; and of this advantage the
young Bohemians appear to have availed themselves
to the full. Anecdotes abound to tell of the
hilarious but very harmless festivities which mitigated
the discouragements of their task. A
contemporary undergraduate well recalls the mirth
and chatter which he heard day by day as he sat
in the adjacent library. Such a group of congenial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>spirits could not fail to enjoy the conditions of their
companionship as much as the audacity of their
task. They were favoured, further, with a new
acquaintanceship of a very welcome kind; for it
was here that another young poet, Algernon
Charles Swinburne, was now introduced, as an
undergraduate at the university, to the artists at
their work, and added an important link to the
chain of memorable friendships woven in these
early years among the galaxy of genius which has
illumined the England of to-day. It was in Oxford
also, at the theatre one evening, that Rossetti saw,
and succeeded in getting introduced to, the beautiful
lady who afterwards became William Morris’s
wife, and Rossetti’s most cherished friend through
all his troubles. She was the model for his “Day-dream”
and several others of the finest of his
maturer works.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hapless frescoes are now hardly recognizable
upon the Oxford walls, but their dim ghosts
linger, like the kindly witnesses of days fruitful, at
least, in loves and friendships of sacred import on
the lives of the young sojourners in that “home of
lost causes, and forsaken beliefs, and unpopular
names, and impossible loyalties,” as Matthew
Arnold called it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, it was at Oxford that the Pre-Raphaelite
movement, five or six years earlier,
had found some of its first and most generous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>patrons; such as Mr. James Wyatt, the well-known
picture-dealer, who was among Millais’s
readiest buyers, but died in 1853, and Mr. Thomas
Combe, the University printer, who, through
Millais’s influence, purchased Holman Hunt’s
youthful and little-known picture, “Christian
Priests Escaping from Druid Persecution,” in
1850. About three years later, Holman Hunt
was on a visit to Mr. and Mrs. Combe while his
greater work, “The Light of the World,” was in
process; and at their house he became acquainted
with the young curate of St. Paul’s, Oxford;
Venables by name. He was a man saintly in face
and character; afterwards Bishop of the Bahamas,
and long since dead. Whether he actually gave
sittings to Hunt, or was avowedly the model for
the Christ of the picture, does not appear, but
those who knew Venables at the time insist upon
the absolute faithfulness of the portraiture. This
face it was which certain critics, unable to dissociate
their conception of the Saviour from the
conventional Raphaelesque type, condemned instantly
as “the face of a Judas.” The picture was
purchased by Mr. Combe, and subsequently presented
by his widow to Keble College, Oxford,
where it hangs to-day. Of the difficulties which
attended the painting, and of the extraordinary
labour bestowed upon it as it slowly grew beneath
his hand in the little studio then at Chelsea, Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Hunt has given us his own significant record,—how,
night after night, when the moon was in
a favourable quarter, he would so dispose his
curtains and draperies, easels and lamps, as to
yield him the peculiar light for which he was
striving, and at the same time to afford for
curious observers an endless speculation as to the
mysterious proceedings of the eccentric young
artist within. “The Light of the World” is now
perhaps the most familiar, to English eyes, of any
Pre-Raphaelite pictures, unless we except the less
esoteric “Hugenot” of Millais.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “Hugenot,” indeed, would undoubtedly
be taken by general estimate to point the high-water
mark of Millais’s fame and genius, in spite
of the splendour of the “ninth wave”—if one may
push the metaphor so far—which issued ten years
later in “The Eve of St. Agnes” and “The
Enemy Sowing Tares.” The “Hugenot” appeared
with “Ophelia” in 1852; Hunt’s “Light
of the World” in 1854. And the “Hugenot” it
was that first took unmistakable hold upon the
public taste, and created a higher taste than it
appealed to, carrying the emotion awakened with
it on to higher planes than had yet been reached
in English criticism. “The Order of Release,” in
the following year, consummated the triumph of
the young painter, and was enhanced in fame by
Kingsley’s allusion to it in “Two Years Ago.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“The Proscribed Royalist” and the “Portrait of
Ruskin” may be regarded as the last products of
Millais’s rigidly Pre-Raphaelite period, which terminated,
with Rossetti’s, about 1853. “The
Rescue” and “The Random Shot,” or “L’Enfant
du Regiment,” in 1855, “Sir Isumbras at the
Ford: A Dream of the Past,” or “Knight
Crossing a Ford,” in 1857, and “The Vale of
Rest,” in 1858, are purely transitional works, while,
with the notable exception of the two later masterpieces
specified above, “The Black Brunswicker”
of 1860, may be said to mark the final merging of
the Pre-Raphaelite heretic into the popular Royal
Academician. His formal election as R.A. took
place in 1863. He was made, in 1883, a member
of the Institute of France, and was, in 1885, the
first English artist to be offered and to accept a
baronetcy of the United Kingdom. He has also
become a member of the Academies of Edinburgh,
Antwerp, Rome and Madrid, and has been
honoured at Oxford with the complimentary degree
of D.C.L. His marriage in early life with Miss
Euphemia Chalmers Gray was anticipated in one
of the most pleasing of his female portraits in 1853.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the companion of his student days
had entered upon a path of more obscure and
arduous toil, in the pursuit of an ideal too exalted
to endure compromise with any standards of the
merely picturesque, or to lend itself readily to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>fluent and attractive expression. The work of
Holman Hunt, among all the Pre-Raphaelite
painters, has remained the most consistent and
exclusive in its aims and methods, and the least
affected by surrounding influences, either from his
comrades or from the critical world. His artistic
development has been the most faithful to its
origins, and has presented the most unbroken
continuity of thought and sentiment in its progress
from the first “note of resistance and defiance” to
the larger harmony of maturer years. The boundaries
of his transition-period are more difficult to
define than in the case of Millais and Rossetti;
but, at the same time, the pictures that issued from
his studio while Rossetti was dabbling in experimental
water-colours, and Millais compromising
brilliantly between original genius and the sweet
laxities of fame, were of a passion and mastery
which he never exceeded. Before the completion
of “The Light of the World,” in 1854, Hunt had
already painted “The Awakening Conscience”
(1853), “Claudio and Isabella” (1851), “The
Hireling Shepherd” (1852), and “The Strayed
Sheep,” called also “Our English Coasts” (1853).
He now departed to commence those long, solitary,
and most fruitful sojourns in Jerusalem, Bethlehem,
and less frequented parts of Palestine, which gave
us, at the cost of years of intense and continuous
labour, such great imaginative creations as “The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Scapegoat” in 1855, “Christ in the Temple” in
1860, “The Shadow of Death” in 1874, and “The
Triumph of the Innocents” in 1885. “The
Shadow of Death” was purchased for £10,500; a
price unparalleled for the work of any other living
painter. The picture now hangs in the Manchester
Corporation Gallery. Seven years were
spent over “The Triumph of the Innocents,” pronounced
by Ruskin to be “the greatest religious
picture of the age.” The final version, completed
in 1885, has recently been acquired by the Walker
Art Gallery in Liverpool, where it completes, with
Millais’s “Lorenzo and Isabella” and Rossetti’s
“Dante’s Dream,” a noble trio of the best Pre-Raphaelite
type. Reverting, as he did but once,
to more purely romantic subjects, and to that
haunting theme of Keats which first inspired the
young Brotherhood, Mr. Holman Hunt produced
in 1867 the finest of his work in that direction, in
the brilliant “Isabella and the Pot of Basil,”
which was the outcome of a visit to Florence in
that year. His only important picture of later
years has been the “May Morning on Magdalen
Tower,” a fascinating reminiscence of Oxford life,
exhibited in 1889.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even more obscure and remote from the general
routine of the modern studio, more independent of
criticism or of patronage, was the earnest and
thoughtful work of Madox Brown. In his case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>the early discipline of art study, and the isolation
of unconventional ideals, had been courageously
survived before he knew Rossetti, and his path
already chosen on the heights of original thought.
“He was,” says Mr. W.M. Rossetti, “distinctly an
intellectual painter; intellectual on the side chiefly
of human character. The predominant quality in
all his works is a vigorous thinking out of the
subject, especially as a matter of character, and of
dramatic incident and expression thus resulting.
This is the sort of intellect peculiarly demanded
by pictorial art.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is noticeable also that the two senior members,
if they may be so claimed, of the Pre-Raphaelite
circle, though not of the actual Brotherhood—Ford
Madox Brown and George Frederick Watts—were
the only painters who brought into the
movement any direct training from the continental
schools. The latter, one year older than Madox
Brown, was born in London in 1820, and succeeded
in getting a picture into the Royal Academy
as early as 1837. The prize of £300 gained in
1843 in the Westminster Hall Competitions
enabled him to spend three years in Italy, after
which, on his return, he won a prize of £500 in
the same contest, with two more colossal frescoes
of a similar kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Madox Brown, meanwhile, was entering upon
the more uncompromising phase of reform. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>was during his studies in Rome and Paris, when
the Gothic traditions of Belgium had been strongly
tempered by the Latin heritage of the south, that
the Pre-Raphaelite idea began to shape itself in
his mind, and to develop in him an original art
which should create its own conditions and methods,
yield a rich harvest of artistic if not of
professional success, and exercise an immense
power for good over the movement which his
own single-handed battle with convention largely
stimulated and inspired.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wicliff Reading his Translation of the Bible
to John of Gaunt” was afterwards acknowledged
by Madox Brown as his first distinctly Pre-Raphaelite
picture; begun in 1845, and shortly
followed by “Pretty Baa-Lambs”—the only other
work which the artist claimed as being painted
implicitly in the early Italian style. The latter
was subjected to much derisive criticism in the
press. Yet the later work of this unquestionably
great painter, maintained as it was on his own
rigidly independent lines, and never merging into
the fervid neo-Romanticism of Rossetti, Millais,
and Hunt, may justly be accepted, like theirs at
its best, as a consistent and superb development,
in a modern atmosphere and in the face of modern
problems, of the principles followed by the Italian
Pre-Raphaelites, and which <em>as principles</em> are
adaptible in infinite variety to the fresh needs and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>new perplexities of successive generations of
men.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1849 the work of Madox Brown appeared
for the first time beside that of Rossetti. “Cordelia’s
Portion,” a highly imaginative and nobly
dramatic composition, was hung in the Free Exhibition
at Hyde Park Corner, in company with
Rossetti’s “Girlhood of Mary Virgin.” His next
important picture, “Chaucer at the Court of
Edward III.,” occupied the painter for several
years, and was produced at the Royal Academy
of 1851—the memorable season of Hunt’s “Valentine
and Sylvia,” and Millais’s “Woodman’s
Daughter.” The “Chaucer,” now in Australia,
received the Liverpool Academy’s annual prize of
£50 in 1852, and was selected by Government
for the Paris Exhibition Loan Collection of English
paintings in 1855.</p>

<p class='c000'>The departure of his young friend Woolner for
Australia in 1854 suggested to Madox Brown the
subject of his most popular and in some respects
his most successful picture, “The Last of England,”
finished in 1855, and now exhibited in the
Art Gallery of the Corporation of Birmingham.
It was his visit to Gravesend, to bid farewell to
Woolner as he embarked for the Antipodes, at the
time when the emigration movement was at its
height, that inspired the elder painter with that
homely idyll of emigrant life—that masterpiece in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>the dramatic and emotional presentment of modern
and familiar romance. In 1857 he painted
his great symbolic picture “Work,” which has
been pronounced “the finest Pre-Raphaelite picture
in the world;” a verdict not without justification,
but bordering on those facile abstractions
of criticism wherein the sense of comparative
excellence is apt to lose itself in the confusion of
diverse methods in art. The picture now hangs
with the masterpieces of Rossetti, Millais, and
Holman Hunt, in the Walker Art Gallery at
Liverpool. Among the many friends of that
period who gave sittings to the artist for the
principal figures were Frederick Denison Maurice
and Thomas Carlyle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the achievements of Madox Brown in the
more obviously romantic and naturalistic fields,
perhaps the best known is the intensely passionate
and brilliant “Romeo and Juliet” parting at daybreak
in the loggia to Juliet’s chamber. In the
same category, though of various range and style,
may be briefly mentioned “Waiting” (1855), a
fine study of firelight and lamplight, which appeared
in the Russell Place Pre-Raphaelite Exhibition
of 1856, “The Death of Sir Tristram,”
“King René’s Honeymoon,” the much earlier
“Parisina and Manfred on Jungfrau,” and “The
Dream of Sardanapalus,” a work of recent years.
The romantic treatment of historical subjects is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>represented by the cartoons before mentioned,
executed prior to 1848, and by such later compositions
as “Cromwell Dictating to his Secretaries,”
“Milton and Marvel,” and “Cromwell on
his farm at St. Ives,” completed in 1873. Of his
religious pictures perhaps the most familiar is the
austerely beautiful “Entombment;” but it is not
easy to excuse the discreditable oblivion permitted
in this country to such paintings as “Jesus Washes
Peter’s Feet,” “The Transfiguration,” “Our Lady
of Good Children,” or “Elijah and the Widow’s
Son;”—oblivion only too explicable by a single
trait of national character: that the average Briton
will accept any innovation of taste or doctrine
that will allow him to take his pleasure with the
least amount of intellectual disturbance, but he
will never forgive the artist who calls upon him to
<em>think</em>. Happily some worthier, though very far
from adequate, recognition has been accorded to
the almost colossal task of the painter’s later years—the
great series of historical frescoes on the
walls of the Town Hall, Manchester, commencing
with the building of Manchester by the Romans,
and bringing the history of the city pictorially
down to the present day. Outliving many
younger leaders of the Pre-Raphaelite movement,
Madox Brown died on the 6th of October, 1893.</p>

<p class='c000'>The artistic development of Madox Brown does
not, then, offer any abrupt or marked transition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>from the first crude workings to the perfected
application of the Pre-Raphaelite idea. This he
pursued steadfastly, and with an unhasting diligence
and quiet independence of spirit which
indicates his kinship of temperament to Holman
Hunt rather than to his impulsive and volatile
pupil Rossetti, or to the impressionable Millais of
early days. The complete outward divergence
between the art of Madox Brown and that of
Rossetti after, let us say, the “Triptych” for
Llandaff Cathedral, painted by the latter in 1859–1860,
illustrates not only the consistent progress of
the former in his own distinctive line, but also the
extraordinary fertility and cumulative splendour
of Rossetti’s genius, which could create for itself
during the next fifteen years so much more
original and versatile a habit wherewith to clothe
the noble and exquisite visions that thronged his
imagination, each with the urgency of “a presence
that is not to be put by.”</p>

<p class='c005'>For the last twenty years of Rossetti’s artistic
life he was known, and should be judged, supremely
as a colourist; and from 1862 to 1874 his
technical power reached its highest level. After
completing in oils the “Triptych” for the Llandaff
altar-piece, “The Infant Christ Adored by a
Shepherd and a King,” Rossetti began to pursue
more carefully, and with increasing success both
from the æsthetic and the professional point of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>view, the system of half-length or three-quarter
length female figure-studies, chiefly symbolic in
motive, which he had already attempted brilliantly
in the “Bocca Baciata” (“The Kissed Mouth”)
of 1859, and which afterwards yielded such imaginative
and technical triumphs as “Beata Beatrix”
(1863), “The Blue Bower,” one of the most
brilliant and sensuous of his paintings (1864);
“Lady Lilith,” the type of purely physical loveliness,
described in his sonnet “Body’s Beauty”
(1864); “Il Ramoscello” (“The Branchlet”), or
“Bellebuona” (“Fair and Good”), a gem of
pearl-white colouring (1865); “Monna Vanna,” a
superb study in white and gold (1866); “Venus
Verticordia,” personifying again the earthly Pandemos,
with the apple of temptation in her hand
(1864–1877); “The Beloved, or the Bride of the
Canticles;” and “Sibylla Palmifera” (“Beauty the
Palm-giver”), both typifying intellectual and
spiritual beauty (1866–1873); “The Loving Cup”
(1867); “Aurelia,” or “Fazio’s Mistress” (Angiola
of Verona, loved by Fazio degli Uberti, mentioned
by Dante), another somewhat sensuous model
(1863–1873); “La Pia,” the unhappy and captive
wife of Nello della Pietra (from Dante’s “Purgatorio”),
seen in her prison overlooking the Maremma
(1868–1881); “Mariana,” from Shakespeare’s
“Measure for Measure” (1869–1871); “Pandora
opening her fatal casket” (1869–1875); “Proserpine,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>empress of Hades, enchained to the nether world
(1872); and “La Ghirlandata”—“The Garland
Girl”—(1873). Into these splendid and highly
finished studies of the mystic beauty of womanhood,
Rossetti poured the full soul of his gospel of
romantic love—the love of absolute Beauty absolutely
worshipped to the utmost reaches of a consecrated
sense,—“Soul’s Beauty” and “Body’s
Beauty” now analyzed and set in contrast each
with each, now reconciled and made at one in the
last harmony of perfect life. And in these great
creations—revelations rather, and perceptions of
the inmost verities of things, Rossetti attains the
consummation of imaginative art—the crowning of
romanticism with the purged inheritance of the
classic ideal. It has been claimed that romance
treats of characters rather than types; prefers, as
we have said, the particular to the universal; and
that Rossetti’s women are but splendid models,
lovely sitters brought by a happy chance into his
path, and used by him as the illustrations of that
individual beauty which appealed most strongly to
his taste. But in these rich harvests of his technical
maturity the very realism has discovered the
ideal, and as in pure portraiture, the sincere essence
of classicism is regained.</p>

<p class='c000'>A peculiar pathos must for ever be associated
with one of the first, and, in the judgment of many,
the most beautiful, of these half-length oils, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>exquisite “Beata Beatrix,” now in the National
Gallery. It is the supreme pictorial record of that
central tragedy of Rossetti’s life, even more intimately
revealed to us in his verse, which set him
at the side of Dante among mourning poets. On
the 23rd of May, 1860, Rossetti married, at Hastings,
the beautiful and gifted woman of whom his
courtship had lasted nearly ten years. The
wedding had been delayed again and again
through the uncertain health of Miss Siddal and
the precarious circumstances of the brilliant but
wayward young painter’s life. It was now accomplished
with every augury of long-anticipated joy.
The honeymoon was spent in a brief tour through
Belgium, concluding with a few days in Paris,
where Rossetti made his little impromptu sketch—so
entirely out of his wonted trend of themes—“Dr.
Johnson and the Methodist Ladies at the
Mitre;” a pen-and-ink drawing which he afterwards
repeated in water-colours.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thence to the old rooms in Chatham Place,
Blackfriars, partially rebuilt and redecorated for
the happy event, Rossetti brought home his bride.
The face of the long-desired wife now haunts the
painter’s easel more continually than before, and
recurs with ever-varying charm in nearly all his
sketches and the very few finished pictures of the
next two years. To this period belong “Lucretia
Borgia” (entirely distinct from the “Borgia” of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>1851); “The Heart of the Night” (from Tennyson’s
“Mariana in the South”); the beautiful
“Regina Cordium”—“Queen of Hearts” (a title
also used for other portraits at different dates);
“Bethlehem Gate,” and the best of several subjects
dealing with the legend of “St. George and
the Princess Sabra,” together with “Monna Pomona”
and “The Rose Garden” of 1864, “Sir
Tristram and Iseult Drinking the Love Potion”
(1867), “Washing Hands” (1865), and many replicas
of the Dante pictures of the previous
decade. And in the numerous rough and half-finished
portrait sketches, nameless but unmistakable,
of Rossetti’s “Queen of Hearts” during
those two brief years, the shadow of the coming
bereavement can be traced in the gradually
sharpened features, the more and more fragile
hands, the look of increasing pallor and weariness
in the earnest face which rests, in one of the latest
drawings, on the pillow all too suggestive of its
habitual place. On the 2nd of May, 1861, Mrs.
Rossetti gave birth to a still-born son. From the
consequent illness she rallied considerably during
the autumn of that year, and the immediate cause
of her death in February, 1862, was, unhappily,
an overdose of laudanum, self-administered after
a day of fatigue, during the brief absence of her
husband from the house. Of the circumstances of
the fatal mischance, in so far as they can ever be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>gleaned from that calamitous hour, of the utterly
unexpected shock awaiting Rossetti’s return, and
of the grief-stricken apparition which aroused the
household of Mr. Madox Brown on Highgate
Hill at dead of night with incoherent news of the
fatality, enough has already been written by those
whose sad privilege it was to share in some measure
with the overwhelmed sufferer the long pain
of that supreme bereavement. The pathetic incident
that added to the sadness of the burial, when
the young widower hastily gathered up all his
poetic manuscripts of the past ten years and laid
them beside the fair face in the coffin, a symbol
of that best part of himself which he felt must go
also to that untimely grave, has become an oft-told
tale; and may now be laid in the reverent silence
of affection and regret. Nor can the agony and
prostration of the succeeding months be fitly recorded
save in his own chronicles of song—the
great elegiac “Confessio Amantis” of the “House
of Life” sonnets.</p>

<p class='c000'>Recruiting at last in slow degrees his powers
upon brush and canvas, he dedicated their first-fruits
to the painting of that most beautiful and
faithful memorial of the beloved dead—“Beata
Beatrix,” the Blessed Beatrice—Dante’s Beatrice;
for the immortal story loved in youth had now redoubled
its hold upon his heart. The picture was
commissioned by Lord Mount Temple, who was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>from this time one of Rossetti’s most generous
patrons and intimate friends. It was begun at
Mr. Madox Brown’s house, “The Hermitage,” on
Highgate Hill, but finished at Stobhall, in Scotland,
whither Mr. Brown and an equally devoted
friend, Dr. John Marshall, had taken the painter
in the hope of restoring his now shattered health
and assuaging the sorrow that had occasioned its
collapse. Rossetti afterwards said of the “Beata
Beatrix” that no picture had ever cost him so much to
paint, but that in no other task had he been conscious
of so perfect a mastery of his instruments.</p>

<div id='i190'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/illus_190_h.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>It should be remembered that of this picture,
and indeed of several of Rossetti’s finest and best-known
works, certain indifferent replicas exist
which have been frequently mistaken for their
originals. The “Beata Beatrix” in the Birmingham
Art Gallery was only half painted by Rossetti,
and finished by Madox Brown. Again in the case
of “The Blessed Damozel” of a much later date,
the more familiar version is the inferior one.
There was also a smaller replica of “Dante’s
Dream,” shown in London at the Guildhall Loan
Exhibition of 1892. Moreover, it was Rossetti’s
habit to execute most of his pictures in more than one
medium; thus many of his early pen-and-ink drawings
were presently reproduced in water-colour;
the water-colour designs of 1852–1862 were afterwards
transferred to oils; and most of the important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>oil-paintings of his maturity were duplicated in
coloured chalk; some even passing through the
pencil, ink, and water-colour stages also. Not
infrequently it happened that the chalk version
surpassed all the others, as, for instance, in the
grand “Pandora” of 1878–79, the most powerful of
all his drawings in that medium, and perhaps the
greatest of his symbolic figures. Very often, too,
he would begin a picture on a very small scale,
and gradually enlarge it through successive stages
to its final size, as in the case of “Monna Rosa,”
concerning which he writes on the 18th of June,
1867, to his patron, Mr. F.R. Leyland, one of the
most constant and sympathetic of his buyers
and friends,—“The picture is much advanced
and in every way much altered, as I have again
had it considerably enlarged! To begin a
fresco as a pocket-miniature seems to be my rule
in Art.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The domestic calamity of 1862 rendered a change
of residence imperative to the young widower, left
desolate amid surroundings charged to the utmost
with poignant memories of the past. The old
rooms in Chatham Place became unbearable to
Rossetti, full as they were of associations of courtship
as well as of married life. He sojourned for
a time in chambers in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and
in the autumn of the same year he moved to No.
16, Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, where he lived intermittently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>up to the time of his death. It was a
fine old house, well suited to be an artist’s abode;
and especially fortunate in a large garden, which
became a valuable resource to Rossetti in those
sad days in store for him when any emergence
from the seclusion of home grew more and more
distasteful to his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the end of October Rossetti seems to have
been established in his new dwelling, which thenceforth
it was his pleasure to adorn with all the quaint
old curios he could lay his hands on. In the
natural revulsion of overwrought feeling, he threw
himself upon decorative hobbies of many kinds;
developed a passion for blue china and antique
pottery; cultivated oriental textures and old oak;
and haunted second-hand furniture warehouses
with the pertinacious enthusiasm of the devout
lover of a bargain. His shelves groaned under
their picturesque load of reliquary wares and studio-properties
gathered from every age and clime.
Here, too, flourished a whole colony of curious
animals, such as he delighted to indulge with unbridled
license in his domains,—to the produce of
countless anecdotes of their pranks, and of the
embarrassment of their victims.</p>

<p class='c000'>The house was shared for some time with three
brother-poets,—Swinburne, George Meredith, and
W.M. Rossetti. The last-named was for a considerable
period a constant inmate; the others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>less domesticated, and of strong peculiarities (as is
the way of genius) of habit and of taste, presently
departed, and their places knew them only as
visitors to the brilliant haunt of many other literary
celebrities of the day. It has been observed that
the most intimate friends of Rossetti’s later years
were drawn from the ranks of literature rather than
art,—a circumstance which need not, however, be
too closely paralleled with his own frequent and
increasingly successful reversions to the poetic
field. It must be remembered that the Pre-Raphaelite
movement presents a combination of
the highest poetry with the highest pictorial and
decorative art incomparable with anything since
the days of Michaelangelo. It was natural that
the poetic wing of Pre-Raphaelitism, so to speak,
should attach itself more and more firmly to the
great group of independent and specialistic poets
of the age, of whom no counterparts in original
genius are to be found outside Pre-Raphaelitism
in modern English art. As early as 1855 we find
Rossetti well acquainted with Tennyson and in
close friendship with Browning and Mrs. Browning;
afterwards with William Morris, several of whose
poems were inspired by Rossetti’s pictures; whose
first volume, “The Defense of Guenevere,” was
dedicated “To my Friend Dante Gabriel Rossetti,
Painter,” in 1858; and whom Rossetti pronounced
to be “the greatest literary identity of our time;”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>then with Swinburne, whom he placed “highest in
inexhaustible splendour of execution,” and whose
first-fruits in the tragic drama, “The Queen Mother,”
in 1860, were similarly inscribed; and later still
with Philip Bourke Marston, the blind poet; with
George Meredith, Edmund Gosse, John Payne,
and many others of the choicest if not the most
popular qualities of song. From among the
earliest of those memorable friendships there is
preserved to us a fascinating record of one autumn
evening, typical of many more, when the Rossettis
and the Brownings assembled together to listen to
Tennyson as he read from manuscript his latest
poem;—it is the now familiar pen-and-ink sketch
of “Tennyson Reading Maud;” one of those
marvellously vigorous and convincing thumb-nail
drawings which it was Rossetti’s wont to evolve,
in his inimitable method, from the initial focus of
a single blot.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1865 we find Rossetti writing to the
“Athenæum” to correct a statement which seems
to have been made to the effect that he, known
chiefly as a water-colour painter, was now attempting
a return to oils. The artist protested that he
was then, and always had been, an oil-painter;
and indeed, as we have seen, he was just now at
his zenith of power in that medium, though the
contrary impression made on the public is easily
explicable in the light of his water-colour work of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>the previous decade, and of the Russell Place
Exhibition of 1856.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time the irreparable loss of the one loved
model of his early prime was in some degree
mitigated, from the artistic side, by the good
fortune which secured for him henceforward some
of the most beautiful sitters known to the artistic
world of the day; women of high culture and distinction,
who added to their willing service in the
studio the grace of personal friendship and, in
several instances, of patronage of the most sympathetic
kind. The austere and robust beauty of
Miss Herbert, the accomplished actress to whom
he was introduced in 1859, lay, as has been already
said, entirely apart from his most cherished ideals,
and seldom appears in his symbolic paintings.
But Mrs. Aldham Heaton, a frequent and valued
purchaser, and a lady of presence more congruous
with his favourite type, sat for what appears to
have been a second “Regina Cordium” in 1861;
while in 1864 was commenced his long and most
artistically fruitful acquaintance with Miss Wilding,
the beautiful girl who served as the model for
“Sybilla Palmifera,” “La Ghirlandata,” “Dis Manibus,”
“Veronica Veronese,” “The Sea-Spell,”
and several others of his most delicate and spiritual
faces, including a third “Regina Cordium” in
1866. Miss Spartali, afterwards Mrs. Stillman,
was also a favourite model for some years, and sat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>for “Fiametta” (distinct from “A Vision of Fiametta”
in 1878), and for the lady on the right of
the funeral couch in “Dante’s Dream,”—a work
which remained on hand throughout this period.</p>

<p class='c000'>Apart from the models of his principal pictures,
Rossetti painted at different times a goodly number
of female portraits, commencing the list of sitters
with his mother and younger sister (the elder died
at a somewhat early age), and including Lady
Mount Temple, who became, with her husband,
one of the few intimate friends of his seclusion in
later years, Miss Alice Boyd, the kindly hostess of
some of his happiest visits to Scotland, yet to be
recorded, Mrs. William Morris and her daughters—among
them Miss May Morris, now Mrs. Halliday
Sparling, who also appears in the “Rosa
Triplex” of 1869 and 1874, Mrs. Burne-Jones,
Mrs. Dalrymple, Mrs. H.T. Wells, Mrs. Leathart,
Mrs. Lushington, Mrs. Virtue Tebbs, Mrs. C.
A. Howell, Mrs. Coronio, Miss Heaton, Miss
Williams, Miss Kingdon, the Misses Cassavetti,
Miss Baring, and Mrs. Banks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Twice during these years of the gradual maturing
of his technical power in oils did Rossetti
make excursions into a distinctive branch of decorative
art, the practice of designing for stained-glass.
As early as 1860, William Morris, Burne-Jones,
and a few others interested in this much-neglected
craft established a firm which was known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>for some time under the name of Morris and Co.,
and for which in 1861 Rossetti executed a series of
seven effective cartoons for church windows illustrating
the “Parable of the Vineyard,” or the
“Wicked Husbandmen.” Both designs are of
extraordinary vigour and dramatic intensity;
strongly mediæval in directness and simplicity,
but with a large coherence and fulness of conception,
and a harmonious richness of workmanship
breathing a more modern spirit into the ancient
tale. The dignity and earnestness of the drawing
places it on a level with the best work of his
purely romantic period, but its technical finish
shows the more perfect balance between conception
and execution which he was rapidly attaining
in his maturity. The designs are now to be seen
in the church of St. Martin on the Hill, Scarborough.</p>

<p class='c000'>A similar work was undertaken by Rossetti six
years later, when it was proposed to dedicate a
memorial window to his aunt, Miss Margaret
Polidori, in Christchurch, Albany Street, Regent’s
Park, where she had long been a regular attendant
until her death in 1867. Rossetti chose for his
subject “The Sermon on the Plain.” This design
also was executed in stained-glass by the firm of
Morris and Co., and placed in the church in
1869.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time Rossetti’s commissions for pictures
had happily become so numerous as to justify his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>seeking competent assistance in his studio. His
friend Mr. Knewstub, at first a pupil, filled for
some time the office of assistant. Then Mr.
Henry Treffry Dunn was engaged in 1867, and
remained with Rossetti almost up to the date of
his death. It seems to have been in the years
1867–68 that his health, never fully re-established
after the physical and mental prostration of 1862,
began to give way beneath that most terrible and
relentless of nervous maladies, the special curse of
the artistic temperament—insomnia. To that
slow and baffling torment, by which Nature sometimes
seems to be avenging herself in a sort of
frenzied jealousy upon her own handiwork, Rossetti’s
highly wrought sensibilities and overwhelming
imagination made him the more easy prey.
His whole being was constitutionally endowed
with that fatal faculty of visualizing the invisible,
of suffering more acutely under imagined than
under realized pains (though both were laid upon
him) which, like an all-consuming fire, burns itself
out only with the life that feeds it. Of such sleepless
nights as thus become the terror of their
victims, haunted with all memories and all fears,
Rossetti has left us many a painfully vivid word-picture
in his poetry; supremely, perhaps, in that
most tragic sonnet, “Sleepless Dreams”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Girt in dark growths, yet glimmering with one star,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>ending with the despairing cry upon the deaf
goddess of repose—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O Night, Night, Night! art thou not known to me,</div>
      <div class='line'>A thicket hung with masks of mockery,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And watered with the wasteful warmth of tears?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Many such nights Rossetti bore, we may well
believe, before he fled at last, when rational means
seemed of no avail against his malady, to that
most dangerous source of ease, the too free use of
chloral. Several times he partially shook off the
habit, and intervals of comparative comfort and
cheerfulness were frequent until 1872, when other
phases of illness, independent of it though still of
nervous origin, further undermined the constitution
already weakened by years of abnormal strain.
A respite of a very pleasant kind was afforded
him in the successive autumns of 1868–69 by his
visits to Miss Boyd at Penkill, in Perthshire,
where, in company with other congenial spirits, he
spent some weeks of comparative happiness and
ease. Here he was induced to resume his poetry,
which, save for a few significant sonnets, had lain
in abeyance since that sad day on which he had
buried his manuscripts in the grave of his early
love. Now, yielding with much reluctance and
conflict of heart to the persuasion of friends who
knew the value of the poems thus lost to literature,
he gave permission for the coffin to be exhumed, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>the manuscripts removed. The story of this delicate task,
and of its judicious and successful fulfilment
under the personal superintendence of two
or three intimate friends of the widower, has
already been related in detail by one of the eye-witnesses
aforesaid. The poems, after seven
years’ concealment in the quiet grave in Highgate
Cemetery, were duly restored to their author’s
hand. This having been done, he set to work
arranging, re-writing, and adding some of the
finest work of his poetic maturity to a collection of
poems which should be an immortal record and
perpetuation of his love.</p>

<p class='c000'>Towards the close of 1869 Rossetti began to
share with his friend William Morris the romantic
and picturesque old manor house of Kelmscott,
near Lechdale, in Gloucestershire; a district full
of interesting landscape, and haunted by the inspiring
shade of Shelley, who there wrote his characteristic
fragment, “A Summer Evening in
Lechdale Churchyard.” The scenery of the
surrounding country is brought in vivid glimpses
here and there into Rossetti’s poetry, as, for
instance, in “Down Stream” (“Between Holmscote
and Hurstcote”) and other lyrics of his later
life. Here he painted “The Bower Maiden”—a
pretty country lass with marigolds. But a great
part of his time was still spent at home in Chelsea,
where in 1871 he at last completed the finest oil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>version of “Dante’s Dream.” Save for the incomparable
“Beata Beatrix,” it is the summing-up
of all his highest interpretations of the Dante
spirit; the consummation of his gospel of romantic
love. His friend Mr. Val Prinsep quotes Rossetti
as writing in a letter about this time:—“I should
like of all things to show you my big picture
‘Dante’s Dream’ now, if you are ever in town.
Indeed, I should probably have written to you
before this of the picture being in a state to see,
on the chance of its accelerating your movements
townwards, but was deterred from doing so by the
fact that every special appointment I have made to
show it has been met by the clerk of the weather
with such a careful provision of absolute darkness
for that day and hour, that I tempt my fate no
more in that way, as the picture cannot absolutely
be seen except in a fair light, and one’s nerves do
not hold out for ever under such onslaughts....
Everyone who has seen the ‘Dante’s
Dream’ (not yet quite finished, but close upon), has
seemed so thoroughly pleased with it that I think
I may hope without vanity some progress has been
made, and this I feel sure I shall carry on in my
next work. Of course I have only shown the
‘Dante’ to a few, as otherwise I might spend my
time in nothing else, the picture blocking up the
whole studio when displayed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Ten years later, in 1881, the “Dante’s Dream”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>gained for the painter one of the very few popular
triumphs of his lifetime. It was exhibited at Liverpool,
bought by the Corporation of that city for
£1,500, hung in the Walker Art Gallery, where it
now remains; and instantly took rank among the
greatest masterpieces of modern art. “Fifty years
hence,” said Sir Noel Paton, “it will be counted
among the half-dozen supreme pictures of the
world.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The story of the last ten years of Rossetti’s
private life, clouded by frequent ill-health, and
disturbed by that most intolerable of a poet’s trials,
a literary controversy, remains yet to be told by
him who shared most intimately the seclusion and
the affliction of that troublous period, Mr. Theodore
Watts; whose oft-quoted sonnet to his friend, as
Mr. Coulson Kernahan has said, gives a fuller
picture of Rossetti than volumes of prose could do,
and therefore commands insertion here:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I told thee of an island, far and lone,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Whose shores are as a harp, where billows break</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In spray of music, and the breezes shake</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er spicy seas a woof of colour and tone,</div>
      <div class='line'>While that sweet music echoes like a moan</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In the island’s heart, and sighs around the lake,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Where, watching fearfully a watchful snake,</div>
      <div class='line'>A damsel weeps upon her emerald throne.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Life’s ocean, breaking round thy senses’ shore</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Struck golden song, as from the strand of day:</div>
      <div class='line in2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>For us the joy, for thee the fell foe lay—</div>
      <div class='line'>Pain’s blinking snake around the fair isle’s core,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Turning to sighs the enchanted sounds that play</div>
      <div class='line'>Around thy lonely island evermore.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The mingled pain and privilege of Mr. Watts’s
ministry was shared to a great degree by Lord and
Lady Mount Temple, Mrs. Sumner, Dr. Gordon
Hake and his son, Mr. George Hake, Mr. Madox
Brown, Mr. Frederick Shields, and Mr. Sandys.
Mr. Leyland also saw him frequently, and added
generous and unremitting friendship to his patronage
of the wayward painter’s work. He was the
purchaser of some of the most important pictures
of Rossetti’s last decade, including the beautiful
“Dis Manibus,” or “The Roman Widow,” (1874),
which remains unsurpassed for delicate purity and
depth of colour by any of the masterpieces of his
prime; “Mnemosyne,” or “La Ricordanza,” or
“The Lamp of Memory” (1876–78), one of his
most noble and impressive symbolic figures; “The
Sea-Spell,” (1875–77), and a replica of “The
Blessed Damozel” (1873–77), which he painted
for Mr. William Graham in illustration of his own
poem:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Blessed Damozel leaned out</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From the gold bar of heaven;</div>
      <div class='line'>Her eyes were deeper than the depths</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of water stilled at even:</div>
      <div class='line'>She had three lilies in her hand</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the stars in her hair were seven.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>The publication, in 1870, of Rossetti’s volume
of “Poems,” containing, together with some of his
loveliest short lyrics, “The Blessed Damozel,” and
the “House of Life” sonnets, led the way for that
unfortunate attack upon him in the critical press
which undoubtedly contributed to the shortening
of his days, however regrettable may have been the
hyper-sensitive manner in which the poet met his
arraignment. In 1871 an article signed “Thomas
Maitland” was published in the “Contemporary
Review,” entitled “The Fleshly School of Poetry,”
in which Rossetti’s poems were attacked, from an
avowedly moral point of view, on the ground of
sensuality. Ignoring the essential principles of
all Rossetti’s work—the sacredness of the senses
as the instruments of the soul—the meaning of
all physical beauty as the witness of an immanent
God—the writer deliberately charged him
with pandering to the lowest instincts of his
readers, and being, in short, the prophet of
that later and grossly materialistic phase of European
art of which the very name <em>Pre</em>-Raphaelite
was a repudiation. It is not surprising that to
a deeply (if undefinedly) religious nature like
Rossetti’s this should have seemed the hardest
blow that could have been dealt at his art
and at him. The publication of the magazine
article, however, seriously disconcerted him at the
moment. It was not until the offensive and wholly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>unfair indictment was re-issued in the following
year in pamphlet form that it began to assume a
more serious aspect in the victim’s eyes. Criticism
of his poetic methods he could have borne with
equanimity. Indifference and neglect seldom
troubled him. He cared little for popularity, and
was no seeker after fame, although he naturally
desired the appreciation of those whose judgment
was of real account in literature. But he did care
for his general reputation as a clean-lived and pure-minded
man. This charge assailed the ethical
foundations of all his work. He had seen in the
loveliest things of earth the vessels and channels of
the loveliness of heaven. And that this should be
counted to him for sensuality—that the love which
had been to him “a worship and a regeneration”
should be held up to scorn as a gross and carnal
passion—that was the intolerable thing!</p>

<p class='c000'>Not that he lacked defenders. His own answer,
under the title of “The Stealthy School of Criticism,”
in the columns of the “Athenæum,” was
more than supported by Mr. Swinburne’s indignant
challenge, “Under the Microscope;” and other
loyal friends contributed to a sufficient vindication.
Save in the too morbid imagination of the poet,
the attack soon lapsed, for the most part, into the
oblivion it deserved; more especially since the
writer, a few years later, had the manliness to
retract his charge, and to make a candid apology,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>though a tardy one,for having uttered it. But not
so easily could the pain given to Rossetti be overcome.
He now began to shrink intensely from
society, fearing at all points to encounter that
suspicion of his artistic work. Suffering acutely
from nervous prostration and insomnia, he yielded
himself the more fully to the fatal chloral habit
which only aggravated his condition. In the
autumn of 1872 he spent some weeks at the house
of Dr. Gordon Hake at Roehampton, and proceeded
thence with Mr. Madox Brown, Mr. George Hake,
and Mr. Bell Scott to Stobhall in Perthshire, on
the Tay. Returning to the south in improved
health, Rossetti and Mr. George Hake proceeded at
once to Kelmscott Manor, where they settled for a
considerable time. Rossetti indeed remained for
nearly two years, gradually resuming his artistic
work, and regaining at times something of his old
vivacity and high spirits: only a few friends went
to and fro in visits full of mutual delight and inspiration.
The beautiful old house, and the quaint,
romantic chamber that served for studio, became
the resort of poets and artists, critics and connoisseurs,
disciples and aspirants, in companies
small indeed, but brilliant and memorable as any
that gathered round the young Pre-Raphaelites in
Newman Street or the maturer masters of art and
song that assembled in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea.
Mr. William Morris and his family were there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>frequently; Dr. Gordon Hake made a visit, and
afterwards embodied his memories in his sequence
of sonnets addressed to Mr.Theodore Watts, “The
New Day,” one of which deserves quotation:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O happy days with him who once so loved us!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>We loved as brothers, with a single heart,</div>
      <div class='line'>The man whose iris-woven pictures moved us</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From Nature to her blazoned shadow—Art.</div>
      <div class='line'>How often did we trace the nestling Thames</div>
      <div class='line in2'>From humblest waters on his course of might,</div>
      <div class='line'>Down where the weir the bursting current stems—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There sat till evening grew to balmy night,</div>
      <div class='line'>Veiling the weir whose roar recalled the strand</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Where we had listened to the wave-lipped sea,</div>
      <div class='line'>That seemed to utter plaudits while we planned</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Triumphal labours of the day to be.</div>
      <div class='line'>The words were his: ‘Such love can never die;’</div>
      <div class='line'>The grief was ours when he no more was nigh.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And as his health continued to improve,
Rossetti’s poetry and painting rose again to their
highest level. The former, indeed, is thought by
some sound critics to reach at this juncture a
superb merit unattained before; for it was here
that he wrote the first of the three great romantic
ballads which mark the zenith of his poetic power.
“Rose Mary” stands supreme in this incomparable
category. Nor did he ever far surpass, if at all, his
pictures of this period,—“The Bower Maiden”
(1873) for frank and vigorous natural beauty in
the pretty child with the fresh-blowing marigolds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“Dis Manibus” or “The Roman Widow” (1874)
for delicate and simple pathos in the treatment of
the classic world; and “Proserpine” (1874) for
the sombre moral tragedy symbolized in the
classic story, seldom, if ever, so interpreted on
canvas before.</p>

<p class='c000'>In these years also he painted the beautiful
“Garland Girl,” “La Ghirlandata” (1873), and
“Veronica Veronese” (1872), called at first “The
Day-dream,” but wholly distinct from the later
work of that date; reverted, or endeavoured to
revert in sketches, to his old fantasy of “Michael
Scott’s Wooing,” and resumed a subject begun
in 1864, but never quite fully worked out, “The
Boat of Love,” suggested by Dante’s second
Sonnet,—<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“Guido, vorrei che tu e Lapo ed io,”</span>
and representing Dante and Beatrice embarking
in a boat with his friend and brother-poet Guido
Calvacanti, and his lady Giovanna, and Lapo
degli Uberti and his love.</p>

<img src='images/illus_211_h.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>In the autumn of 1874 Rossetti returned to
Chelsea, and again made his headquarters at 16,
Cheyne Walk, where he remained, save for two
visits to the seaside, until 1880. Here he worked
from time to time at the picture illustrative of his
own early poem, “The Blessed Damozel,”—the
sole instance, by the way, of Rossetti’s completion
of a subject in verse before attempting it on
canvas; and began what promised to be among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>the most profound of his mystical creations, “The
Sphinx” or “The Question,” and also the last
subject he ever took from the “Vita Nuova” of
Dante, “La Donna della Finestra,” or “Our Lady
of Pity.” These two, as well as “The Boat of
Love,” remained unfinished in his studio. To
this fruitful decade belong an excellent replica
of an early water-colour, “The Damozel of the
Sanct Grael” (1874); the exquisite crayon drawing
“The Spirit of the Rainbow” (1877); and four
splendid oils, “The Sea Spell” (1876), “A Vision
of Fiametta” (1878), “The Day-dream” and
“Mnemosyne” or “The Lamp of Memory”
(1880). To 1875 is due “La Bello Mano”
(“The Beautiful Hand”). In 1879 he made a
crayon drawing, which he called “Sancta Lilias,”
for an Annunciation; depicting a girl unfolding a
white scarf from a tall lily which she carries in
her hand; but the sketch was never finished, nor
advanced beyond the crayon stage.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1875 Rossetti took for a time a pleasant and
secluded house near Bognor,—Aldwick Lodge,
standing in its own grounds, wellnigh buried in
shrubbery, in a lane west of the town, and near (as
Dr. Hake tells us in some delightful reminiscences
of a visit there) “to the roughest bit of beach on
the Sussex coast.” Here, gathering together his
mother, sister, and aunts, and such intimate friends
as Dr. Hake and Mr. Theodore Watts, he enjoyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>at the close of this year a Christmas week
to which he afterwards looked back as to one of
the happiest he ever spent.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was at Bognor that Rossetti, influenced, no
doubt, by his companionship, woke for the first
time to the magic of the sea. It is extraordinary
that so passionately romantic a spirit as his should
have remained, until the eve of his fiftieth year, absolutely
unaffected by that profound and intimate
sway which the sea holds over the poetic nature
once brought, however distantly, within even the
rumour and echo of its majestic voice. Now the
spell he had so long eluded was cast upon him
with irresistible force. He began to haunt the
shore with a child’s eagerness for the grandeur
and the urgent mystery of tides. Day after day
he paced the beach for miles together, pursuing
the new vision, the new rapture of the stimulated
sense. The surf, tumultuous and loud on that
wild coast, enthralled him like a charm; the waves
drove his fancy to new spheres; his poetry was
turned to fresh scenes and subjects; he began to
write “The White Ship,” the first, though perhaps
not the greatest, of his historic ballads. For the
time, he was absorbed almost wholly in that revelation
of splendour and power,—in the primal
glories of sea and sky; “two symbols of the
infinite,” as the captive Mazzini called them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when we wonder at the lateness of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>æsthetic development on Rossetti’s part, we must
remember that he was naturally without that love
of terrestrial and cosmical Nature for her own
sake that is the commonly-accepted attribute of
poets. There was in his whole being no trace
of Pantheism, no worship of external loveliness
apart from conscious life. To him the sole joy
of life was in the human; the supreme tragedy
of life was in the sexual. The conception of the
two elemental principles—the man-principle and
the woman-principle—striving, uniting, prevailing,
against all the forces of destiny, sufficed him for
his conception of the universe. He was utterly
alien to the Wordsworth spirit; its serene monism
was abhorrent to him. Apart as he lived from
intellectual speculation, he was, in his unformulated
and unconscious philosophy, dualistic to the core;
as all true Romance must ever be. For the
essence of Romance is in its recognition of the
conflict between matter and spirit, between Nature
and Man. Even its joy and exultation in the
physical life as the channel of the Higher Spirit
takes its glory from the sense of conquest over
the Lower Spirit which threatens it from the
same unknown world behind all. Therefore there
lies always beneath the awe and wonder of romance
towards the natural and the supernatural world
a deep instinct of rebellion, of antagonism,
which debars it from the Wordsworth spirit, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>peace with earth and heaven. Resignation there
may be in romance; acquiescence, never. There
may come, indeed, a passionate and whole-hearted
love of natural scenery, a frank delight, as in the
Celtic temper, in every external object that can
minister to man’s æsthetic enjoyment of beauty as
a revelation of the divine. But the limits of the
divine grow more perceptible as man emerges
from the childhood of the world. “There hath
passed away a glory from the earth.” Rossetti
knew this—“knew” it, not in the intellectual sense
of the word; and therefore he could never turn to
Nature for that regenerating rest and peace which
in some moods—not quite the highest—she can
give. He never gained that next stage of spiritual
emancipation and enrichment at which the sense
of conflict is its own reward; as when the soldier,
with “his soul well-knit” and every nerve schooled
and chastened on the eve of a great battle, feels a
profound repose, a diviner calm than that of the
acclaimed victor. “The man who, though his
fights be all defeats, still fights”—as Coventry
Patmore sang while Rossetti was yet young—has
verily seen “the beginnings of peace.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was at Bognor, too, that he began work upon
the most ambitious of all his great symbolic figures,
the “Venus Astarte,” or “Astarte Syriaca,” in
which he strove—vainly perhaps, but with a superb
effort towards a superhuman task—to combine and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>express all the mystic sensuousness and occult
magic of Orientalism with the clear and scientific
wisdom of the Western world. The Syrian Venus
stands “between the sun and moon a mystery,”
attended by winged and torch-bearing choristers;
eloquent of the painter’s long and last struggle to
reconcile sense, emotion, and intellect in the
highest consummation of pictorial art.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the following summer (1876) Rossetti paid a
pleasant visit, at the invitation of Lord and Lady
Mount Temple, to their house at Broadlands, in
Hampshire, where he made some progress with
the best version of “The Blessed Damozel.” The
predella to this work, in which the lover left on
earth is seen waiting beside a river for the vision
of the Beloved, was painted from the beechwoods
of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1876 Rossetti went with Madox Brown, Mr.
George Hake, Mr. Theodore Watts, and his
mother and sister to Herne Bay. Ill health had
now settled permanently upon him, and painting
became more difficult and intermittent, yet his
technical power remained for the most part singularly
unimpaired. In 1878 he completed “A
Vision of Fiametta,”—an admirable and wholly
new version of the subject from Boccaccio which
he had treated some years back. Fiametta is in
the painter’s thought an angel of immortality:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Gloom-girt ’mid Spring-flushed apple-growths she stands”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>—his bright Easter-maiden, with the crimson bird
on the bough beside her, the symbol of warm, full-blooded
life, as is the soft red robe she wears,—of
life so rich and sweet as to yield the guarantee of
victory; the spirit that can defy death and be its
own assurance of resurrection. The apple-blossoms
fall in scattered petals to the ground as she pushes
the boughs apart with her lifted hand. Behind
her is a stormy April sky, but around her head
there plays a light, as of hope beyond the grave.
She is the covenant of eternal spring, for she</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>—“with re-assuring eyes most fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>A presage and a promise stands; as ’twere</div>
      <div class='line in2'>On Death’s dark storm the rainbow of the soul.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>But now the time was nigh when “Death’s dark
storm” must break upon Rossetti. The last great
and sane strength of his genius was spent upon
poetry,—in the crowning of his romantic ballads
with the masterpiece of their class, “The King’s
Tragedy.” This was published, in a volume
entitled “Ballads and Sonnets,” in 1881. The
previous year had seen the completion of the last
important picture that ever came fully finished from
his hand,—an oil version of the almost full-length
figure replicated several times, under the name of
“The Day-dream,” and consisting of the most
beautiful and perfect of his portraits of Mrs.
William Morris.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the laborious conscientiousness of Rossetti’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>practice in painting it may here be said that it has
been greatly under-estimated by those who only
saw the less serious side of his complex and self-contradictory
nature. That “the capacity for taking
infinite pains” developed with the genius which
gave it scope is abundantly attested by those who
witnessed not only his restless roving from one task
to another, but also the ungrudging concentration
of toil which he bestowed in turns upon them all.
Mr. Shields, who for years was a constant companion
in Rossetti’s studio, says in his too-brief
record of that intimacy:—“One evening when the
fine full-length figure, holding an open book and
honeysuckle, called ‘The Day-dream,’ was nearly
completed, I found him standing far off from it in
the dusky light and searching it critically. ‘It
seems to me, that the lower limbs are too short:
what do you think?’ An examination compelled
me to endorse his fears. It was enough. Condemnation
to the effacement of half the picture was
instantly passed. Long sprays of young sycamore,
rich with the ruddy buds of early spring, crossed
before the lady’s green skirt. That sacrificed, it
was not possible to save the foliage, and the season
was too far advanced for fresh reference to
nature. The first necessary step therefore was to
copy these on to a clean canvas; that done, he
determinately scraped out the large erring surface,
corrected the proportions of the figure, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>calmly re-painted all, striking lastly the sycamore
boughs into their new places from the rescued
studies.” An even more laborious re-painting, says
the same authority, was effected in the final oil
version of “Dante’s Dream,” completed in 1871.
The figure of one of the ladies attendant at the
bedside of the dead Beatrice failed to satisfy him
in the disposition of her drapery. At the last
moment he set to work to make entirely new studies
for the robe in question, and almost wholly re-painted
the figure that wore it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the autumn of 1881, which witnessed the
publication of his second volume of original poetry,
Rossetti went with his friend Mr. Hall Caine, the
eminent novelist, to spend some weeks at a little
farmhouse in the Vale of St. John, near Keswick,
Cumberland. The surrounding scenery was of a
wildly beautiful kind, well calculated to soothe and
inspire the city-pent poets; but Rossetti was by
this time too ill to find relief from nervous strain
in the long walks which he had enjoyed at Bognor.
He paced instead, for hours together, the quaint
little sitting-room where, night after night, he would
read aloud from the treasures of modern fiction.
Of Rossetti’s acute critical faculty, and his sound
literary judgment alike in poetry and prose romance,
abundant testimony has been given by the many
privileged to enjoy from year to year, especially in
the period of his prime, the inestimable help and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>delight of his enthusiastic counsel and his frank,
outspoken, but never ungenerous criticism. Such
witness is fully endorsed by Mr. Caine’s records
even of this last autumn of his life, when, through
shattered health and failing hopes for his own
future, he retained in a great measure the mental
vision and acumen of happier days, as well as his
own creative power in design and poetry. Rossetti
never tired of these nightly discussions of the
inexhaustible topics of literary art: he loved to
prolong them far into the morning hours; and often,
as his friend has told us, they saw the sunrise break
over the great hills as they went at last to rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor was the year without fruit in painting.
The pathetic picture of “La Pia,” a new design in
oils, though with a title used for a sketch in 1867,
ranks high among his later performances. The
subject, briefly broached in Dante’s “Purgatorio,”
deals with the imprisonment of the young wife of
Nello dell’ Pietra of Siena in a fortress in the
Maremma, in the midst of a noxious swamp.
Rossetti was still at work, too, upon the great symbolic
picture in which he was endeavouring to sum
up all that he had implied in his maturer treatment
of womanly beauty,—the mystic and solemn
“Venus Astarte” or “Astarte Syriaca” (the
Syrian Venus). The “Cassandra” proposed by
him somewhile previously was never far advanced,
but he had painted in 1880 a somewhat inferior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>oil version of a subject which had been the favourite
of his youth, “The Salutation of Beatrice.”</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the very few public triumphs which
came to Rossetti in his lifetime stands in the
annals of 1881. His great picture, “Dante’s
Dream,” painted ten years earlier, was purchased
by the Corporation of Liverpool for £1,500, and
hung in the Walker Art Gallery, where it was at
once hailed with general and almost unalloyed
praise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in February, 1882, prostrated by an
attack of a semi-paralytic character, Rossetti was
removed to Birchington-on-Sea, near Margate,
where his old friend, Mr. John P. Seddon, had
generously placed a house known as West Cliff
Bungalow at his disposal. Mr. Hall Caine went
with him, and they were soon joined by the artist’s
mother, sister, and brother, and visited frequently
by Mr. Watts, and by the young poet Mr.
William Sharp, Mr. Shields, and Mr. Leyland,
who brought with him Rossetti’s long-trusted
medical adviser, Dr. John Marshall, to add his
counsels to the unremitting care of the local
physician, Dr. Harris.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even within sight of the fast-approaching end,
his earnest spirit did not falter in its aspirations,
nor was the grasp of the busy hand upon its loved
work relaxed altogether. He now executed a
beautiful little oil sketch of a subject which he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>attempted many years before—“Joan of Arc
Kissing the Sword of Deliverance;” a striking
and pathetic allegory of his own soul’s attitude, as
he stood ready to greet with glad and fearless
reverence the long-impending sword of the last
Deliverer. He was one of those to whom, as
George Eliot once said, early death takes the
aspect of salvation.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Birchington he reverted also to his picture
of ten years back, “Proserpine.” His last poetry
was written less than a week before his death, in
two sonnets illustrative of his yet unfinished
picture, “The Question,” or “The Sphinx,” in
which the figures of Youth, Manhood, and Age
appear before the Mother of Mystery. Early in
youth Rossetti had made a resolution that no day
should pass without some piece of work, however
imperfect, issuing from his hands, and amid much
pain and weakness, sorrow and discouragement,
he kept that resolution almost till his dying day.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Good Friday, the 7th of April, he became
rapidly worse, but remained cheerful and composed.
On Easter Day the shadow of death hung
over the little household. In the evening the
group of watchers gathered with increasing apprehension
round the bed. “I think I shall die to-night,”
said Rossetti quietly, some hours before
the end. Soon after nine o’clock a momentary
struggle gave warning of the approaching rest.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>His mother, sister, and brother, Mr. Theodore
Watts, Mr. Shields, Mr. Hall Caine, Dr. Harris
and the nurse were with him, when, twenty
minutes later, he passed away, meeting the Deliverer
in perfect calm; seeing, as he himself
expressed it, “on Death’s dark storm the rainbow
of the soul.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On Easter Monday Mr. Shields, at the request
of the bereaved family, made a careful and accurate
pencil drawing of the head of his late friend as he
lay ready for the last sad rites. A plaster cast
of the head, by Brucciani, was also made, but
was not considered satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was decided that the funeral should take
place at Birchington; and there, in the quiet little
graveyard on the cliffs, Rossetti was laid to rest.
Mr. William Sharp and Philip Bourke Marston
(who died five years later) were among the
mourners, besides those already gathered in the
house of grief.</p>

<p class='c000'>The quiet hamlet of Birchington-on-Sea is now
a well-loved place of pilgrimage. The quaint,
un-English-looking house in which the poet-painter
died is honoured as “Rossetti Bungalow.”
In the old, shingle-towered, ivy-grown church, a
stained-glass memorial window, his mother’s gift,
shows, in the one light, his own design, “The
Passover in the Holy Family,” and, in the other,
Christ giving sight to a blind minstrel,—the work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>of his old friend, Mr. Shields. In the churchyard,
opposite the south-west porch, the old verger
shows, with touching pride and enthusiasm, a
beautiful Runic cross, on the face of which is this
inscription:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Another interesting memorial has since been
established in the form of a drinking fountain,
designed by Mr. Seddon, with a bronze bust
modelled by Mr. Madox Brown, erected by subscription
in 1887 in front of the old house, 16,
Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, which was Rossetti’s home
for twenty years.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>An estimate of the disposition and character
of such a man as Rossetti will not be lightly
attempted by those who can only honour his
memory from afar; having never added to the
deep enjoyment of his art the privilege of personal
intercourse with the artist. His tender and passionate
affection, his chivalrous loyalty, his gracious
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>bonhomie</em></span>, his winning dignity, are matters so
familiar to all who really knew him, as to render
eulogy alike superfluous and impertinent. Of the
other side of that magnetic personality,—of his
hyper-sensitive pride, his morbid isolation of his
suffering self from those healthy breezes of broad
intellectual life which it is so easy to prescribe, so
bitterly hard for a nature such as his to stand
against,—of these things it may be said with all
sympathy and reverence that they were the price
of his greatness. There are some temperaments
so finely organized, so delicately strung, that even
joy is painful to them. They cannot lose in the
sense of delight the consciousness of what that
delight has cost them. They perceive so acutely
the realities, the conditions, of life, that an hour of
rapture makes them more quick to the pain behind
and before. Such was Shelley, such were Keats
and Byron; such was Dante Gabriel Rossetti.
It is the curse of the artistic temperament: it is
the blessing of Art.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There are some of us,” said Shelley, “who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>have loved an Antigone before we visited this earth,
and must pursue through life that unregainable
ideal.” “I think,” he added, in words that might
well be applied to Rossetti, “one is always in love
with something or other; the error consists in
seeking in a mortal image the likeness of what is,
perhaps, eternal.” In other words, Rossetti was
an idealist, and for the idealist there is no primrose
path to heaven. His soul was too open to
the ideal to be proof against the actual. His
whole nature was like an Æolian harp, responsive
through the whole gamut of thought and sense to
every breath of circumstance or destiny that played
about the world around it. For him there was
no life without emotion. He craved sensation, as
one craves a narcotic, to destroy its own results.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>Ennui</em></span> was his bane. Nothing in his history is
more pathetic than his need, in later years, of the
perpetual ministry of close friends. The delicate
instrument that could never be silent was hard to
keep in tune. It demanded a firm and tender
hand laid upon all those quivering strings of being
to merge the discords into some sort of harmony,
even if it were always in a minor key. Such a
hand he found more than once among those that
knew and loved him, but he found it supremely
in the friendship of Mr. Theodore Watts, to whom
his last poems were dedicated.</p>

  <h2 id='chap06' class='c004'>CHAPTER VI. <br /> TREATMENT OF RELIGIOUS SUBJECTS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The Re-birth of Religious Art—“God, Immortality, Duty”—The
Pre-Raphaelites and the Reconstruction of
Christianity—The Halo in Painting—The Responsibility
of Womanhood—The “Girlhood of Mary Virgin” and
“Ecce Ancilla Domini”—The Problem of Suffering—“Christ
in the House of His Parents,” “The Passover in
the Holy Family,” “The Shadow of Death,” “The
Scapegoat”—Hunt’s Symbolism—“The Light of the
World”—Rossetti’s Symbolism—“Mary Magdalene at
the Door,” and “Mary in the House of John”—The Idea
of Victory Through Suffering—“Bethlehem Gate”—“The
Triumph of the Innocents”—The Spirit of Inquiry—“Christ
in the Temple”—The Atonement—“The Infant
Christ Adored”—Comparison with Madox Brown and
Burne-Jones—“The Entombment”—“The Tree of Life.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“God—Immortality—Duty;” such were
the weighty words chosen by one of the
greatest women of our century as the
text of a now historic conversation in the shadow
of St. John’s College, Cambridge. The student
to whom she spoke has told us with what a tender
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>solemnity she approached the great postulations
which those words conveyed, and challenged them
in her inflexible judgment one by one;—to her,
how inconceivable the first, how unbelievable the
second, but yet how imperative and irresistible
the third.</p>

<p class='c000'>The attitude of George Eliot, even in the phase
of intellectual scepticism from which she then
spoke, was deeply significant of that fundamental
change in the constitution of religion, that entire
transference of Christian or non-Christian “evidences,”
from the intellectual to the moral sphere,
from the argument to the instinct, which is now
largely accepted as the supreme result of modern
thought in Europe. For the repudiation of prior
conceptions of “God” and “Immortality,” so far
from precluding a reconstructive faith, rather prepared
the way for it; making the belief in unseen
goodness a deduction from instead of a premise to
the recognition of visible goodness in the present
world, and leaving the more scope for that growing
reverence for the physical nature of man which,—having
its origins in Paganism and its highest
sanction in the Gospel of Galilee, and revealing itself
in a passionate exaltation of bodily beauty as a
symbol of the divine, a resolute acceptance of the
laws of nature and destiny, and a strenuous blending
of resignation to those laws with conquest of
them by spiritual powers,—has inspired the great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>humanitarian movement of to-day, wherein the
faith of the future finds the witness and the justification
of its ideal.</p>

<p class='c000'>To what degree, then, has the Pre-Raphaelite
movement in English art affected, or reflected, that
momentous revolution? The pictures of Rossetti,
Millais, and Holman Hunt have been by turns
exalted and condemned by the apologists of contending
theological schools, and the painters
stigmatized, now as followers of Tractarianism
and instruments of Popery, now as leaders of the
coarsest rationalism in sacred art, now as apostles
of a sensual neo-Paganism brought over from the
Renaissance, and credited to hold mystic and
sceptic in equal defiance. One clerical critic, indeed,
in 1857, sought in an ineffectual volume to
prove the essential atheism of all Pre-Raphaelite
work. His protest was but typical of that still
extant species of mind to which the worship of the
body implies the profanation of the soul. It
remains to be decided whether such paintings
touched the deepest religious principles which
underlie all change of creed or ritual, and if so, in
what way the art of the Pre-Raphaelites has joined
or swayed the general current of humanitarian feeling
which is slowly absorbing all forms of religion
into a universal spirit and will.</p>

<p class='c000'>These questions bring us to the great group of
pictures in which English artists for the first time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>have aspired to deal in all simplicity and earnestness
with the bases and principles of the Christian
religion. It should not be difficult to discern the
dominant idea, the moral keynote, so to speak,
of the highest utterances of art in an age of such
religious revolution as has been suggested by the
proposition of George Eliot. The philosophy of
“Duty,” presented by her in its sternest aspect,
but brought more into line with the common heritage
of religious thought by Browning, Tennyson,
F.D. Maurice, and other contemporaries of the
Pre-Raphaelite band, has in fact led in art, as it has
led in religion, directly, if unconsciously, to that
reverent re-discovery of “God,” that transfiguration
of the ideal of “Immortality,” which the revival
of the spirit of romance has made possible to modern
England. It has been said that “the romantic
temper is the essentially Christian element in art.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
Let us rather say that it is the medium through
which Christianity itself has been renewed and
quickened into a richer and fuller life. The romantic
temper, in Pre-Raphaelite art, takes hold of the
eternal verities of the Christian faith, and humanizes
its whole cycle of history and legend in the atmosphere
of the real and present world. It ignores
any sort of dividing line between sacred tragedy
and the great problems of modern time. It abjures
for ever the “glass-case reverence” of relic-worship,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the superstition which isolates Christian history as
a record of exceptional events, instead of an interpretation
of universal experiences. Ruskin justly
says that “imagination will find its holiest work in
the lighting-up of the Gospels;” but the illumination
must have a reconstructive as well as an analytic
consequence; must be, as the late Peter
Walker Nicholson expresses it in his fine critique
on Rossetti,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a> <em>instinctively synthetic</em>—which is the
quality of genius: and all true art is synthetic in
its essence and its end. The tendency of modern
religious science to discredit the exceptional and
the unique, and set the basis of morals in universal
and familiar things,—in other words to
deduce “God” and “Immortality” from the
instinct of “Duty” and not “Duty” from the
arguments for “Immortality” and “God,”—finds its
correlative in the tendency of romantic art to
subject the remote specialities of classicism to the
test of known conditions and actual character.</p>

<p class='c000'>Therefore the four gospels, to the Pre-Raphaelite
painters, do not stand alone as “religious” history,
distinct from the world-wide record of human aspiration
and struggle from age to age. They merely
afford the supreme examples of man’s apprehension
of “God, Immortality, Duty,” and of his capability
of heroic labour and self-sacrifice in the pursuit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>an ideal. The Pre-Raphaelites draw their first
principle of religion from the beauty and glory of
the natural world, and the intrinsic dignity and
sacredness of human life. Their Christ is re-incarnate
in the noblest manhood of all time; their
Virgin Mary lives again in every pure girl that
wakes to the solemn charm, the mysterious power
and responsibility of womanhood. In humanity
itself, with all its possibilities, in its triumphs and
in its degradations, its labours and its sufferings,
they re-discover “God,”—an “unknown God,” it
may be; “inconceivable,” if we will; but evident
in the quickened conscience of a growing world,
and in the invincible instincts of human pity
and love. Millais sees a young Christ in the
delicate boy with the wounded hand in the dreary
and comfortless carpenter’s shop. Hunt sees a
crucified Christ in the tired workman, over-tasked
and despairing amid the calm sunlight of eventide.
Rossetti sees a risen Christ in the noble poet
whose great love could conquer death and enter
upon the New Life in the present hour. The
true Pre-Raphaelitism does not take the halo from
the head of the Christ of history; but it puts the
halo on the head of every suffering child, of every
faithful man and woman since the world began.
It is not that the historic Christ is less divine;
but that all humanity is diviner because He lived
and died.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>In such a spirit does Rossetti conceive “The
Girlhood of Mary Virgin,”—not as a miraculous
but an exquisitely natural thing; miraculous, at
least, in Walt Whitman’s sense of the word,—the
sense in which all beauty and all goodness are
miracles to man. He shows us the up-growing of
a simple country girl, in a home full of the sweetness
of family love; remote and quiet, yet with no
artificial superiority or isolation from the average
world. The maiden in the picture, with an innocent
austerity of face, sits at an embroidery-frame
by her mother’s side. In front of her is a growing
lily, whose white blossoms, the symbol of her
purity, she is copying with her needle on the cloth
of red, beneath St. Anna’s watchful eye. The
flower-pot rests on a pile of books, inscribed with
the names of the choicest virtues, uppermost of
which is Charity. Near to these lie a seven-thorned
briar and a seven-leaved palm-branch,
with a scroll inscribed “Tot dolores tot gaudia,”
typical of “her great sorrow and her great reward.”
The lily is tended by a beautiful child-angel, the
guardian both of the flower and the girl who is
herself, in Rossetti’s words,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“An angel-watered lily, that near God</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Grows and is quiet.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Around the balcony trails a vine, which St. Joiachim
is pruning above; significant of the True Vine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>which must hereafter suffer “the chastisement of
our peace.” The dove that broods among its
branches promises the Comforter that is to come.
The realism of the picture is a realism of the
mediæval kind, that takes possession of, instead
of ignoring, the spiritual world, and overleaps the
boundaries of visible things; depicting the invisible
with the daring confidence of imaginative faith.
The child-angel with her crimson pinions is as
substantial on the canvas as the soberly-clad virgin
at her symbolic task.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the companion-picture, “Ecce Ancilla Domini”
(“Behold the handmaid of the Lord!”)
Rossetti repeats and develops much of the same
symbolism in the accessories of the painting, but
the universal meaning of the Virgin’s call is far
more clearly brought out. The design differs
from all familiar versions of the Annunciation in
that the message is delivered to Mary as she wakes
out of sleep, and that she is depicted, not among
beautiful and well-ordered surroundings, but in a
poor and bare chamber, rising, half-awake, in a
humble pallet-bed, and sitting awed before the
angel whose presence, perhaps, is but the visualized
memory of her dream. The rapt stillness of
her look recalls the pregnant line in which Byron
speaks of a troubled waking,—“to know the sense
of pain without the cause.” In Mary’s mind there
should rather be a sense of joy without the cause;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>but even in her joy there lies a mystery, a burden
of responsibility and foreboded sorrow, that makes
it heavy to bear. It is as if some simple girl,
waking to the golden glories of a summer morn,
should wake at the same time to the thought of
the world’s pain, and realize, in a sudden exaltation
of pity and love, that somehow, by whatever path
of grief and loss, her purity, her goodness, must
help humanity and bless the race to be. The
angel at her side is a girl-child no longer, but a
youth, full of strength and graciousness, as if to
suggest that the sanctities of manhood are now to
be revealed to the maid. In his hand the radiant
Gabriel holds the full-grown and gathered lily,
whose image is now completed on the embroidered
cloth, which hangs near the bed. The dove, the
symbol of the Holy Spirit, flies in at the window,
and the light is soft and warm from the sun-bathed
landscape without.</p>

<p class='c000'>Once again did Rossetti attempt the subject of
“The Annunciation,” but only in a water-colour
sketch, which found a place, however, in the small
but choice collection in the Burlington Club. Here
also the lily affords the symbolic keynote of the
design,—the Virgin is seen bathing among the
water-lilies in a stream; but the singularly fine
conception of the angel’s salutation gives a special
value and interest to the work. The figure that
appears before her on the bank assumes for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>moment the aspect of a cross; being so enfolded
with his golden wings that the Virgin sees not
only the glory of her visitant but the dire portent
of the message which he brings. “The Annunciation”
of Mr. Arthur Hughes is more conventional
in spirit, with its veiled Virgin and its stiffly
self-conscious Gabriel, and lacks the note of prescience
which gives solemnity to Rossetti’s designs.
Mr. Burne-Jones, on the other hand, gives us a
more mature and stately maid. His Mary, nobly
simple though she is, seems better prepared for
the sacred honour of her destiny, and does not
touch us so deeply as the shrinking girl in “Ecce
Ancilla Domini,” or even as the poor beggar-maiden
(for so she appears) in Mr. Hughes’s
“Nativity,” bending timid and reverent on her
knees in the straw before the Holy Child.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the note of prescience, as we have seen,—the
prophetic symbolism which brings to mind
in every incident of the Saviour’s life the whole
scheme of sacrifice and redemption, dominates all
the greatest Pre-Raphaelite work. The suggestions
of the inevitable Cross recur in Rossetti’s
early picture, “The Passover in the Holy Family,”
in Millais’s “Christ in the House of His Parents,”
and in Holman Hunt’s “Shadow of Death,” with
a force and urgency that points at once to the
universal significance of the history. “The Passover
in the Holy Family” shows us the boy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Christ carrying a bowl filled with the blood of the
newly-slain Paschal lamb, and gazing at it with a
mysterious foreboding in his eyes. In the dim
background St. Joseph and St. Anna (or, according
to Mr. William Rossetti, and as seems more
probable, St. Elizabeth), are seen kindling a fire for
the ritual. Mary is gathering bitter herbs, and
Zacharias is sprinkling the door-posts and lintel
with the lamb’s blood. The youthful John Baptist
is kneeling at the feet of Christ, binding His shoe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rossetti, however, does not attempt quite so
bold a translation of the Biblical narrative into
modern form as does Millais when, depicting
“Christ in the House of His Parents,” he sets the
poor and mean-looking child in the midst of almost
wholly English surroundings, in a carpenter’s workshop,
looking out upon a landscape of thoroughly
English meadow-land;—a literalism of method
since adopted with more daring fidelity to local
colour in their respective fields by such later
realists as Fritz von Uhde and Vassili Verestchagin,
and others of the German and neo-French
schools, but never pursued to the same length in
any later experiment from the studios of the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood. Critics probably will
long be divided as to the legitimacy of such a
process, and its success must be judged largely by
the intention of the painter,—whether he seeks
merely to present an historical incident with vividness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>and force, and employs familiar scenery to
emphasize the hard reality of his narrative, and
whether he rather aspires to interpret the universal
truth beneath the incident, and to illustrate its
bearing upon present life; in other words, whether
he desires to impress us (for example) with the
reality of the sufferings of Christ, or with the
problem of human suffering in all ages, of which
the sacred story is at once the type and the key.
It can scarcely be argued that the latter object
does not come within the scope of art. The point
at issue, however, seems to be that the sense of
anachronism aroused by the presentation of great
historical or legendary figures in present-day garb,
amid the surroundings of contemporary life, is apt
to endanger the solemnity of the theme, and to
some extent defeat the object of the painter,—in
which case it may be urged that the failure is quite
as likely to lie upon the spectator’s side.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the literalism of Millais’s picture is eclipsed
by the exhaustive symbolism which he uses in
common with his colleagues of the Brotherhood,
though never carrying it into the elaborate detail
cultivated by Mr. Holman Hunt. The “house”
of Christ’s Parents is a wooden shed, strewn with
shavings and hung with tools. The young Christ
has torn his hand on a nail, and St. Joseph, turning
from his bench, holds up the wounded palm,
which Mary hastens to bind with a linen cloth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>John the Baptist brings water to bathe the hurt
before she covers it, and the elder woman bends
forward to remove the tools with which the boy,
perhaps, has carelessly played.</p>

<p class='c000'>The nail-mark in the palm is an obvious presage
of the coming Cross. The rough planks and the
half-woven basket convey the idea of unfinished
work; and on a ladder overhead broods the ever-present
dove. The picture is inscribed from the
verse in Zechariah,—“And one shall say unto
him, ‘What are these wounds in thine hands?’
Then shall he answer, ‘Those with which I was
wounded in the house of my friends.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>To recover the actual conditions of the early
life of Christ—to reproduce the aspect of a Nazarene
cottage eighteen centuries ago—and yet to
charge the historic figure with a vitality and
emotion that brings it home with irresistible significance
to the heart of the spectator of to-day, is
perhaps a higher triumph of art than could be
achieved by Millais’s neo-realistic method. Rare
as is success in this dual effort—the union of
archæological accuracy with profound insight into
the eternal meanings of the ancient tragedy—it
has been attained beyond question by Holman
Hunt in his greatest picture, “The Shadow of
Death.” Sojourning for four years at Nazareth
and Bethlehem (the latter on account of the alleged
resemblance of its people to the ancient House of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>David), the painter equipped himself with knowledge
of every detail of domestic life, furniture,
custom, and dress that could heighten the literal
truthfulness of his work. To that scientific fidelity
he added the elaborate symbolism of which he
made a studious art, and through that symbolism
he poured a wealth of imagination, a dignity of
thought and an intensity of feeling which steeped
the subject in a moral glow hitherto unknown to
English painting. The scene is laid at sunset in
the carpenter’s shop. The Christ, whose face and
form, now grown to manhood, speak utter weariness
of body and soul, seems to stand there for all
humanity, confronting the whole problem of labour
and suffering and death. There is something
more than physical exhaustion, though that is
paramount, in the drooping figure of the tired
workman as He lifts His arms from the tools and
stretches them out in the evening sunlight, all
unconscious that as He does so, the slant rays
cast His shadow, in the semblance of a crucifix,
upon the cottage wall behind, where a wooden
tool-rack forms as it were the arms of the cross on
which the shadow of His arms is cast; and near it
a little window, open to the east, makes an aureole
of light around His head. His mother, kneeling
on the floor, examining the casket in which she
keeps the long-treasured gifts of the Magi—gold,
and frankincense, and myrrh, glances up and sees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the terrible image on the wall. It is the cross of
a daily crucifixion, rather than of the final death,
that weighs upon the soul of Christ;—the crucifixion
of unhonoured labour in obscurity; the hard,
despised routine of toil endured by the uncomplaining
workers of all time. He knows both the
dignity of labour and its shame;—the dignity, that
is, of all honest, healthy, and profitable toil; the
shame of that industrial slavery which in any
land can make a man too weary to enjoy the
sunset glories or to revel in the calm delights of
eventide.</p>

<p class='c000'>In turning to Hunt’s earlier picture, “The
Scapegoat,” we pass from the problem of the
slavery of labour to the deeper question of vicarious
sacrifice. The solitary figure of the dumb
and helpless animal, dying in the utter desolation
of the wilderness, the unconscious and involuntary
victim of human sin, speaks more eloquently than
any words of the reality and pathos of the suffering
of innocence for guilt. Seldom if ever has the
problem been so directly urged upon us in pictorial
art,—Can the law of vicarious sacrifice be reconciled
with our highest ideals of moral justice? Can
a beneficent and omnipotent God permit one innocent
being, without choice or knowledge, to pay
another’s penalty? Or, on the other hand, can we
formulate any other method by which humanity
could be taught its own solemn power, and its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>absolute community and interdependence of soul
with soul? The painter’s business is to state that
problem, not to solve it; and this Hunt does with
the utmost simplicity, sincerity, and earnestness.
Pitching his tent in the most inhospitable region
on the shores of the Dead Sea, the artist painted
the actual landscape upon which the ancient victim
was cast adrift, to perish slowly in the desert without
the camp; and from that strange, wild studio
his picture came full-charged with the loneliness
and terror of the scene, and the momentous meaning
of the scapegoat’s sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Light of the World,” frequently regarded
as Holman Hunt’s greatest work, though more
mystical and appealing less directly to common
sentiment than “The Shadow of Death,” is purely
symbolic in design and character; and indeed
may be taken to represent the high-water mark of
abstract symbolism, as distinct from Biblical history,
in the paintings of the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood. The circumstances of its execution,
partly at Oxford, and partly in his studio at
Chelsea by moonlight, have already been referred
to. The picture tells no story; deals with no
incident or condition of the human life of Christ,
but presents the ideal figure in the threefold
aspect of prophet, priest, and king. The Saviour
appears in the guise of a pilgrim, carrying a
lantern, and knocking in the night at a fast-closed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>door. He wears the white robe of inspiration,
typical of prophecy; the jewelled robe and breastplate
of a priest; and a crown of gold interwoven
with one of thorns. The legend from Revelation,
iii. 20, gives the keynote of the work: “Behold I
stand at the door and knock. If any man hear
my voice and open the door, I will come in to
him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.”
The fast-barred door, with its rusty nails and bolts
overgrown with ivy, and its threshold blocked up
with brambles and weeds, is the door of the
human soul. The light from the lantern in
Christ’s hand is the light of conscience (according
to Mr. Ruskin’s well-known description of the
picture), and the light which suffuses the head of
the Saviour, issuing from the crown of thorns, is
the hope of salvation. The lamp-light rests on
the doorway and the weeds, and on a fallen apple
which gives the suggestion of hereditary sin. The
thorns in the crown are now bearing fresh leaves,
“for the healing of the nations.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been charged against many Pre-Raphaelite
paintings that their elaborate symbolism, and the
highly subjective development of the designs, require
not merely titles and texts, but footnotes also,
for their explanation. In the pictures of Holman
Hunt especially, this charge may have some
weight; but it may be fairly met by the consideration
of the close and deep thought, the prolonged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>spiritual fervour—unexampled since the Italian Pre-Raphaelites—in
which each masterpiece is steeped,
and which surely brings a claim upon such intelligent
study as would enable all but those wholly
ignorant of Christian symbology to interpret the
details for themselves. Rossetti said of one of
Hunt’s pictures that “the solemn human soul
seems to vibrate through it like a bell in a forest.”
That sound, once caught, yields the keynote to the
pictorial scheme, and attunes all the latent music
to its perfect end.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rossetti, however, in no case employed the
symbolic-figure method, so triumphantly used in
“The Light of the World,” for his Biblical subjects;
but reserved it for the realm of romantic
allegory and classic myth. His illustration of the
eternal truths of penitence and aspiration, of “the
awakening conscience” and the resurrection of the
soul, is given us in his beautiful drawing of “Mary
Magdalene at the door of Simon the Pharisee.”
The scene is laid amid the revelry of a village
street at a time of festival. Mary, passing with a
throng of gay companions, sees, through the window
of a house, the face of Christ; and with a
sudden impulse leaves the procession and tears
the flowers passionately from her hair, seeking to
enter where He sits; the while her lover, following,
strives to dissuade her, and to lead her back
to the mirthful company. The appeal of passion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>and the answer of the repentant woman, beautiful
in her mingled shame and triumph, are best
recounted in Rossetti’s own words, from the most
successful of his sonnets on his own designs:</p>

<p class='c005'>The face of the Magdalene has been said to
present Rossetti’s ideal of spiritual beauty, in contrast
with the physical beauty of “Lilith” and the
intellectual beauty of “Sibylla Palmifera;” but as
Rossetti himself afterwards applied the title of
“Soul’s Beauty” to “Sibylla Palmifera,” the distinction
can hardly be pursued very far. The head
of Christ (for which Mr. Burne-Jones is said to
have sat as a model) is of a more peculiar interest
and value; being the only serious attempt at the
portrayal of the central figure in Christian art which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>remains to us from Rossetti’s hand. Some highly-finished
studies were made by him for this head,
from one of which the present illustration is taken.
Rossetti’s Christ differs markedly in conception
from that of Holman Hunt. The Christ of the older
painter is pre-eminently the “Man of Sorrows,” the
martyr whose whole life was a crucifixion. Rossetti
shows us rather the Galilean dreamer, the peasant
poet, the gentle idealist whom women and children
loved. The realism of suffering, though delicately
suggested by the slightly-drawn brow, the quiet
tension of the features, and the bright, glowing
depths of the eye, is here in abeyance. Christ is
for the time an honoured guest, receiving the hospitality
of the Pharisee with a gracious self-possession
and an exquisite simplicity of mien. The
sole suggestion, in the surrounding objects, of the
tragedy that is to come, is given in the vine that
trails on the walls of the house, symbolic of the
great Sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shadow of the Cross—no longer cast into
the future, but abiding on the mourners after the
death of Christ—is figured by a device of singular
beauty in Rossetti’s sketch of “Mary in the House
of John.” In a small drawing of “The Crucifixion”
he had depicted St. John leading the Madonna
from the foot of Calvary. Now he shows us the
new home, so strangely ignored by painters of the
sacred tale, wherein the Mother and the adopted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>son are together at eventide. Through the window
is seen a distant view of Jerusalem, and in the uncertain
light the window-bars assume the form of
a cross, which thus appears to rest upon the Holy
City, and to stand between that quiet household
and the outer world. St. John has been writing a
portion of his Gospel, and pauses to strike a light,
with which the Mother of Jesus kindles a lamp,
hanging at the intersection of the bars; so that the
light shines from the centre-point of the Cross,
where the Head of Christ should be. This delicate
emblem gives the touch of hope, the promise of
glory through sacrifice, which lightens the darkness
of the hour. So fine a use of simple imagery, so
perfect an adjustment of the hope to the penalty,
admirably illustrates the highest triumph of Pre-Raphaelite
art,—the reconciliation of the “crucifixion
principle,” the essentially Catholic element
in religion, with the “resurrection principle,”
peculiar to Protestantism. Mr. Forsyth, whose
essays on the Pre-Raphaelites have already been
quoted, makes the suggestive remark, that “In
Hunt’s technique shadow always means colour as
well as darkness: to see colour in shadow is the
last triumph of a great painter,” and adds that
“Rossetti’s colour is not merely luminous matter; it
is transfigured matter.” This conception of the dual
truth of Christianity—the necessity of suffering and
the assurance of victory—is consistently presented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>both by Rossetti and Hunt; and it is not merely
victory <em>over</em> suffering, as Protestantism insists on,
which they teach; but rather victory <em>through</em>
suffering; which is the fusion of Catholic ethics
with Protestant faith.</p>

<p class='c000'>And it is remarkable that the Pre-Raphaelites
find as much inspiration for the thought of victory
through suffering in the incidents of Christ’s childhood
as in the story of His martyrdom. Rossetti,
in his early picture of “Bethlehem Gate,” in which
the Holy Family are seen in flight from the
massacre of the Innocents, depicts at the side of the
Virgin Mother an angel bearing a palm-branch,—the
symbol of deliverance and reward. Holman
Hunt begins the Resurrection with “The Triumph
of the Innocents,” applies, that is, the principle of
Immortality to universal life; and by the ruddy,
healthy faces of his angel-children watching from
Heaven over the child-Christ, he insists, as Rossetti
insisted in “The Blessed Damozel,” that the unknown
world must be something intimately related
to the one we know, and that immortal life must be
something more than the continuance of spiritual
being in an immaterial sphere,—must, in short,
afford real and eternal activities beyond the
grave.</p>

<p class='c000'>This recognition of the relation of sacrifice to
victory leads the painters beyond the reconciliation
of the individual man with God to the reconciliation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>of the social man with man. Something of
this idea of “peace on earth” is suggested by
Rossetti’s picture, “The Infant Christ Adored by
a Shepherd and a King,” which now forms a
triptych in Llandaff Cathedral,—the only picture
directly from his hand which occupies a permanent
position in an English church. In the left compartment
is seen the young David as a shepherd
before Goliath; in the right, the psalmist is depicted
in old age, crowned as a king before God. In the
centre, the Infant Christ appears as the mediator
between the high and the lowly, the rich and the
poor; the messenger of the “at-one-ment” of all
ranks of men, united in a common worship of the
Divine Child, and a common love of that Humanity
of which He is the type.</p>

<p class='c000'>A similar interpretation of the childhood of
Jesus, as typical of the growth of all humanity,
may fairly be drawn from Holman Hunt’s picture of
“Christ in the Temple,”—a work now thoroughly
familiar to English eyes, and perhaps the most
popular because the least mystical of his masterpieces.
The bright, bold, ingenuous face and figure
of the boy, confronting with his eager questions
the venerable Rabbis of the congregation, seems
instinct with the life of the present age, charged
with the very essence of the spirit of inquiry—of
sceptical inquiry even—before which the apologists
of tradition and legalism are dumfounded, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>through which, from the dogma of the old world,
is wrested the faith of the new.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be impracticable here to follow in detail
the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites upon the
religious paintings of their contemporaries and
successors, or to estimate the exact relation of
their work to that of their nearest precursor, Madox
Brown. But a single example from the last-named
artist, and another from the youngest of the Pre-Raphaelite
group, but never numbered with the
Brotherhood—Mr. Burne-Jones—may serve to
illustrate still further the great religious principles
of which these painters steadfastly took hold. “The
Entombment” remains among the finest works of
Madox Brown, and embodies, in its simple austerity,
its direct pathos, a spiritual fervour akin to the highest
inspirations of Holman Hunt. The dignity of the
human body, the solemnity and awfulness of
physical death, the tender charm of child life and
child innocence, the mystery of immortality, and
the apprehension of a “risen” life,—all these things
are brought within the range of thought opened up
by that sombre and majestic design. Seldom in
modern art has the intense realism of death been
so delicately handled, and yet with such uncompromising
force. The faces of the women bending
over the loved corpse are full of grief and perplexity,
yet even in the atmosphere of death there
is a subtle breath of triumph and of hope, a sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>that the body is not all, that what is left is but the
shell, the “house of Life;” the true Life is not
dead, but gone—whither? The tender light that
plays around the mourners, and the contrast of the
vigorous little body of the young child with the
aged and shattered frame of the dead martyr, seem
to voice the eternal protest of the heart against
annihilation, the irrepressible demand of the soul
for a future life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thirty years apart from “The Light of the
World” and “Mary in the House of John,” but
akin to both in motive and spirit, is “The Tree of
Life,” one of the latest and noblest of Mr. Burne-Jones’s
paintings. This sombre monochrome, so
absolutely original in design, so chastened and
restrained in execution, ranks with the highest
symbolic work of the Pre-Raphaelites in its grasp
of the idea of victory through suffering. For “The
Tree of Life” is the Cross. Its roots are in the
very foundations of the earth; its branches are fed
with the heart’s blood of humanity, and its fruit
reaches unto Heaven. The Figure that hangs
upon it is brooding in benediction over the whole
world; the supreme type of that immortal love
which fulfils the divine law of sacrifice; embodying
in one great symbol the lesson of all history,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Knowledge by suffering entereth,</div>
      <div class='line'>And Life is perfected by Death.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Man, woman and children are gathered beneath
the shadow of the Tree. On the one side is a
garden of flowers, and on the other a harvest of
corn. Along the margin of the earth is the inscription:—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“In
Mundo pressuram habebitis; sed
confidite; ego vici mundum.”</span> (“In the world ye
shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have
overcome the world.”) The painting is carried out
in a very low key of colour, and a kind of austere
and grave conventionalism restrains the sweeping
outlines and the sober light. The accessories of
the landscape are of the simplest character; no
extraneous detail intrudes upon the perfect harmony
of the at-one-ment; no over-elaboration mars the
calm of that absolute resignation, that unquenchable
hope. The Christ upon the Cross is at once the
interpretation of the mystery of pain, and the
covenant of a complete redemption wherein man
at last “shall see of the travail of his soul and shall
be satisfied.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It is but an arbitrary classification that divides
the so-called “religious” art of the Pre-Raphaelites
from their portrayals of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>half historic, half legendary wonder-world we
vaguely called “romance.” Rossetti, it has been
rightly said, “was a pilgrim who had got out of
the region of shrines, but who at every cross-like
thing knelt down by the force of thought and
muscle.”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Above all other qualities of Pre-Raphaelite
painting, it is the instinctive perception of
“cross-like things” that gives nobility and tenderness
to the work of Rossetti and his colleagues.
By the light of that inward vision do they choose
and transfigure every theme. The haunting
sense of the mysteries of existence, of the immanence
of the supernatural in the natural sphere,
and of the divine possibilities of human nature; the
apprehension of the moral law, of sacrifice, reward
and penalty, and of the consummation of earth’s
good and evil in an immortal realm;—these abide
with the painters when they pass from the holy
ground of Judea and Galilee to the Pagan splendours
of the Hellenic age, the later glories of mediævalism,
and the hard prose conditions of modern life.
The same great drama of humanity is set before
us, but on another stage, with other players. The
ideas which dominate the minds of the artists, the
principles by which they interpret alike the history
of Jerusalem and the problems of London, are of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>universal application. A classic myth to them is
as rich in meaning as a Christian parable; a legend
of chivalrous manliness or heroic womanhood as
sacred as if written in a canonical gospel. Holman
Hunt’s “Awakening Conscience” and “Claudio
and Isabella” are as profoundly religious as “Mary
Magdalene at the Door;” Rossetti’s “Lady of Pity”
and “Beata Beatrix” glow with a spiritual fervour
as pure as that of “Ecce Ancilla Domini;” the
lessons of Burne-Jones’s “Merciful Knight” and
of Millais’s “Hugenot” are as clear as any that
“The Light of the World” can teach us;—and
this, not that the painters have secularized the
highest things, but that they have sanctified the
lower; have pierced to the common sources of
religious thought and feeling, and have brought into
the labour of the present hour the wide and eternal
meanings of the past.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the most naïve phase of romantic mysticism,
with its devout faith in the presence of spiritual
forces in play at all points upon the human soul,
and in the power of the imagination to visualize
conjectured things, Rossetti conceived the finest of
his early dramatic sketches,—“How They Met
Themselves” and “Michael Scott’s Wooing;” the
former showing the influence of Blake in a more
marked degree perhaps <a id='corr224'></a><ins class='correction' title='that'>than</ins> any other drawings of
the same period. The lovers that “meet themselves”
are confronted, while walking in a wood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>with the apparitions of their own persons, reflected,
as it were, in the air before them, in exact and
startling similitude,—a conception found in the
well-known Döppelgänger legends of German
folk-lore, which credit a dual existence to every
human soul, endowing it with a sort of spectral
“double” after the manner of the Buddhistic
“astral body,” save that the Döppelgänger appear
to be independent of the subject’s consciousness
and will. The sudden terror of the lovers,—the
lady sinking to the ground, the knight drawing his
sword in her defence against the mysterious phenomenon,
yet hesitating, like Marcellus on the
ramparts of Elsinore, to “offer it the show of
violence,” is shown with a force that emphasizes
the reality of the vision to those who see it. In
this picture, as in Rossetti’s treatment of a more
exalted theme, “The Girlhood of Mary Virgin,” the
barrier is over-leaped that separates the visible from
the unseen; the outer and inner worlds are merged
naturally and imperceptibly the one into the other—an
hypothesis in which the previsions of art may yet
be vindicated by scientific discovery; and the forms
of the spectral lovers are scarcely more shadowy
than those who stand aghast before them in the
flesh. It has been suggested that the design may
typify the meeting of the human soul with its prototype
in ages long gone by; the recognition of
unknown kinships (as if brought over from a prior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>existence) through that strange sense of familiarity
which sometimes surprises us when we wander
in spirit through the dim mazes of the historic
past.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the sketch for “Michael Scott’s Wooing,” the
wizard-hero conjures up, for the entertainment of
his lady-love, a magical pageant of Life, Love, and
other symbolic figures, which appear before her in
a glass. Here the purely subjective nature of the
vision is brought out; the lady alone can see the
pageant; her attendants are as blind to it as
Hamlet’s mother to the ghost of the murdered
king.</p>

<p class='c000'>From this initial belief in the potency of the unseen
there comes the apprehension of the mystery
of fate, of the burden of impenetrable destiny, of
the evil powers that assail mankind from within.
Something even of the ancient fear of the jealousy
of the gods against men’s happiness returns in the
mediæval awe of human joys or triumphs, and its
ascetic suspicion of prosperity, more especially in
the field of romantic love. A profound insight of
the dualism of nature keeps the romantic spirit in
remembrance of the cost of all earthly pleasure,
and of the price set by the laws of being upon all
aspiration and desire. This it is that gives its
subtlest charm to the “Romeo and Juliet” of
Madox Brown, with its embracing lovers on the
balcony at break of day, full of the passionate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>poetry of protest against the pitiless caprice, as it
seems, of the fate that tears them asunder; and to
the “Ophelia” of Rossetti,—now sitting troubled
and half-frightened before Hamlet’s earnest gaze,
now offering him the treasured letters from the
casket at her side, now led away in her “first
madness,” by the hand of Horatio, from the
presence of the king and queen; or of Hughes,—singing
dreamily to herself as she sits by the waterside
on a fallen tree; or of Watts,—gazing down
with yearning eyes into the pool beneath the
willow; or—best of all—of Millais, floating downstream
to her death, with her slackening hands full
of flowers, the very embodiment of the pathetic
helplessness of weak and isolated womanhood
against the tide of the world’s strife,—weak, indeed,
through the isolation of ages, having never known,
in life or ancestry, the bracing discipline of a
free and responsible existence. No one of the
Pre-Raphaelites has equalled Millais at his best in
the landscape setting of the struggle between the
human soul and the circumstance that hems it in;
and the scenery of “Ophelia” is among the most
exquisite of his work. The beauty of the river
and its richly wooded banks, its overhanging
branches, and its current-driven weeds, gives the
greater pathos to the dying girl’s face, on which
the wraith only of its past and lost beauty lingers
to mock the sadness of her end. “The Woodman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Daughter” suggests even more finely the
contrast of the unimpassioned glory of nature and
the tragedy of romantic love; for here it is not
death but life, the complexity of life and duty, that
separates the lovers each from each. Between the
rough and uncomely peasant girl and the shy young
aristocrat who stands so awkwardly before her with
his proffered gift of hothouse fruit, there is a gulf
fixed which will take a higher civilization than ours
to bridge over. And again, in treating of the
broader and more common loves and joys of
humanity, does Millais set before us the same contrast
in “The Blind Girl” and “The Vale of Rest.”
The Blind Girl is a poor and uncomely vagrant
halting by the road-side, wrapping her shawl round
her child-guide, who nestles against her in the
April weather. But around her is the loveliness
of an English village landscape after rain. The
warmth of the bursting sun consoles her as she
turns her face to its light; the rainbow which she
cannot see gives radiance to the humble cottages;
the wet grass is cool to her hand, and the peace of
resignation seems to fill her maimed and darkened
life. But the contrast of her sorrow with nature’s
joy is very real, though for the moment she forgets
it in the little comfort that may yet be hers. The
same resignation in the face of the unanswered
problem transfigures the mourners in “The Vale
of Rest,”—the two calm, almost stoical nuns in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>convent garden at sunset time. The younger
woman is digging a grave; the elder, who sits on
a recumbent tombstone hard by, is gazing at the
burning gold and crimson of the west, and sees in
the midst of its splendour the darkness of the
coffin-shaped cloud which, by a widespread superstition,
was long deemed the omen of approaching
death. The superb “Autumn Leaves,” which
Mr. Ruskin pronounces “among the world’s masterpieces,”
may perhaps be added to this great group
of romantic landscapes, inasmuch as the pathos of
its poetry is no less deep, though more subtle, than
that of “Ophelia,” “The Woodman’s Daughter,”
“The Blind Girl,” and “The Vale of Rest.” A
group of children are burning dead leaves in the
twilight of a mellow autumn day. Oblivious of
the changing seasons, realizing nothing of the
solemnity of autumn, or the sad significance of the
waning year, they revel merely in the bonfire they
have made, and are troubled by no fear for the
winter, or for the chance of spring.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the several paintings from Keats’s “Isabella”—that
favourite subject of the early days of the
Brotherhood—the contrast lies mainly in the direction
of individual character; the tragedy, in the
power of such character to work for evil against
the good. Especially in Millais’s masterpiece,
“Lorenzo and Isabella,” are the beauty and
graciousness of Isabella and her lover set with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>passionate intensity against the icy cynicism and
sensuous brutality of the brothers and their guests,
and the conflict is felt to be directly between
malicious cruelty and innocent love. On the other
hand the devotion and self-abandonment of
Isabella’s thwarted passion find noble expression
in the picture by Holman Hunt. The figure of
the weeping girl, who has risen from her bed to
worship at her strange and terrible shrine,—the
Pot of Basil containing her murdered lover’s head,
is seen in the early light of dawn, that almost
quenches, in its pitiless coldness, the more tender
light of the lamp that burns in the little sanctuary
of secret love. The altar-cloth spread for the
sacred relic is embroidered with a design of passion-flowers,
and every accessory is symbolic of Isabella’s
grief and despair. The same unique subject, it
may here be noted, has inspired one of the finest
paintings of an artist worthily representative of the
younger generation of Pre-Raphaelites (if the name
may be perpetuated beyond its immediate and
temporary significance)—Mr. J.M. Strudwick;
whose design, however, deals with the culmination
of the tragedy, the theft of the Pot of Basil by the
guilty brothers, and the on-coming madness of
Isabella.</p>

<p class='c000'>A stronger moral element is soon perceptible in
the work of Rossetti and Millais when they
approach the poetry of Tennyson for subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>matter, and begin to draw upon the great cycle of
Arthurian legends which he restored in modern
garb to English literature. Even outside the
“Idylls of the King,” in their paintings of
Tennyson’s “Mariana,” the passion and the
mystery of romantic love are tempered with the
growing consciousness of moral responsibility, of
Love’s heroic power to conquer destiny—if only
the appeals of the lower nature were not so urgent
and so sweet. In other words, the lower dualism
has given place to the higher; the conflict is not
so much between the earthly joy and the misfortune
that threatens it in death or any calamity from the
physical sphere, but rather between the baser and
the better life within. Of such a spirit is the
“Mariana” of Rossetti, kneeling and weeping in
her dimly-lit chamber in “The Heart of the Night,”
or of Millais, wearily casting away her unfinished
work in the close prison of the “moated grange”—that
perfect allegory of modern love, pent in by
the mire of indolence and conventionality, and
vainly dreaming of an unearned ideal; waiting for
the deliverance which, as Mariana scarcely comprehends,
must be a self-deliverance into nobler
aims and higher standards of duty and of intelligent
sacrifice. The sense of a lofty spiritual destiny
re-enters at this point into Pre-Raphaelite art;
the meaning of the search for the Holy Grail is
apparent still more clearly in Rossetti’s “Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Galahad in the Ruined Chapel,” and later, in
Burne-Jones’s more severe and chastened types of
the pilgrim-knight. It has been charged against
both these painters that the physical beauty and
glory of manhood was almost wholly absent from
their conception of life. Even in the nearest
approach to such a concession, in the latest romantic
masterpiece of the younger artist, “The
Legend of the Briar Rose,” the asceticism learnt at
the Arthurian shrines persists, indeed, in the
mellowness of his maturity. The heroes of the
Pre-Raphaelites are no muscular warriors, as conventional
art would portray them. They are concerned
with inward conflicts rather than with
outward foes. They are the knights-errant of a
new chivalry,—to whom moral righteousness is a
higher thing than physical courage; self-conquest
a nobler triumph than the routing of armies. For
they “wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
against principalities, against powers, against the
rulers of the darkness of this world, against
spiritual wickedness in high places.” The whole
series of the Arthurian designs, from the illustrations
to Moxon’s “Tennyson” and the frescoes at
Oxford, onward to the latest work of Burne-Jones
and his followers, are dominated by this idea of a
spiritual pilgrimage, as of beings exiled from a
higher realm, which to regain they must needs
pass through the lower. “Their sojourn on earth,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>says M. Gabriel Sarrazin,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a> “oppresses these Pre-Raphaelites,
lost among our pre-occupations of
business and of ease.”</p>

<p class='c000'>And further, the sense of the supernatural world,
of the struggle between the spiritual and the
physical in man, leads onward to the conception
of retribution and punishment, “not” (as Hegel
puts it) “as something arbitrary, but as <em>the other
half of sin</em>.” The inexorableness of the moral law
could hardly be more finely suggested than in
Rossetti’s treatment of the guilty love of Lancelot
and Guinevere. “King Arthur’s Tomb,” despite
its crudity and harshness of drawing, remains
among the most superb of his early drawings.
The aged queen, now an abbess honoured and
revered, is visiting the tomb of the dead Arthur.
But not all her long atonement of remorse and
piety can avail wholly to blot out the sin of her
youth. For even here, as she kneels to pray, the
dark and terrible ghost of Lancelot thrusts itself
between her and the pure effigy whose marble face
she seeks in penitence and tears. The converse
of the picture was that of which Rossetti sought
to make a fresco on the ill-fated walls of the
Oxford Debating Union. The design represents
“Sir Lancelot before the Shrine of the Sangrael.”
He seems to have almost attained the goal of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>pilgrimage; the Holy Grail is just within his
grasp; but in the hour that might have brought
victory, the old sin brings mockery and defeat:
the face that looks out at him from the place of
his hope is the sad, reproachful face of Guinevere.</p>

<p class='c000'>With scarcely less of tragic force and direct
solemnity does Rossetti carry this thought of
retribution into the world of mediæval Italy, into
the cycle of legend and romance that gathers
round the name of Dante. The love-story of
“Paolo and Francesca da Rimini,” recorded by
Dante in the “Divina Comedia,” has been the
theme of poets and painters for many a year, and
is the subject of one of the finest water-colour
drawings made in Rossetti’s transition period.
Francesca, the wife of Lanciotto, the deformed
son of the lord of Rimini, fell in love with her
husband’s brother Paolo; and Lanciotto, discovering
the two in guilty companionship, put
them both to death. In the fifth canto of the
“Inferno,” Dante describes the terrible sight permitted
to him of the condemned lovers in the
second circle of Hell. Rossetti’s picture is in
triptych form, and in the centre are the figures
of Dante and Virgil, his guide. Above them is
the brief inscription, “O Lasso!” In the left compartment
is depicted the fatal embrace of Paolo
and Francesca at the moment of the avowal of
their love, when in reading together the story of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Lancelot, the book suddenly fell from their hands,
and, as the narrator simply confesses, “that day
we read no more.” In the right-hand space are
seen the lovers, clasping each other wildly in the
darkness and among the furious storms of hell,
unable to release themselves from that fixed embrace.
The characteristic idea of making the
penalty consist in the involuntary perpetuation
of the sin,—the guilty love becoming, as it were,
its own sufficient punishment, belongs, of course,
to Dante, but is worked out with singular power
in Rossetti’s design. Not only is the stern and
relentless fate portrayed with the utmost sincerity
in the sequel, but even in the first panel
the thought of the coming retribution is finely
suggested by the introduction of one sufficient
touch at the background of the scene. Beneath
the edge of a curtain is seen the foot of the
approaching husband, bringing his vengeance and
the lovers’ doom. The same subject has been
more elaborately and completely treated by Mr.
G.F. Watts, whose picture shows Francesca
telling her sad tale to Dante and Virgil as they
pass; and the poet who is said to have known
her on earth, and to have written the record
quoted from the “Inferno” in the house at Rimini
in which she was born, is depicted sinking in a
swoon before her, overcome with pity and with awe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, and in a widely different field of dramatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>narrative, does Rossetti bring this passionate sense
of retribution into play. His drawing for the
never-finished picture, “The Death of Lady
Macbeth,” is full of the same half-pitiful and half-triumphant
spirit of righteous vengeance, and the
same perception of inexorable penalty. The aged
and dying woman crouching on her bed has once
been comely and of commanding countenance;
and in her last hour the remembered beauty of
her face, the lingering majesty of her figure, seem
to overawe her attendants, one of whom presses
a sponge to her head. In that changed face the
conflict between remorse and pride, ambition and
terror, is still fierce and strong; but she is dying
utterly alone: there is no love, no tenderness,
in the ministry of those who gather round the
murderess.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still more clearly and resolutely is this perception
of moral issues sustained by the Pre-Raphaelites
when they pass from history and legend to
classic mythology, to allegorical type, or to the
dramatic presentation of modern life. In the
“Awakening Conscience” of Holman Hunt, in
the exquisitely pathetic “Psyche” of G.F. Watts,
in the “Hesterna Rosa,” “Gate of Memory,” and
“Found” of Rossetti, the bitter cost of sin is
realized with unfaltering consistency. Rossetti’s
long-laboured and yet uncompleted “Found” may
be taken as the companion, if not the sequel, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>his poem, “Jenny.” It shows us the last humiliation
of a ruined girl who is “found”—dying on
the streets of London—by the lover of her youth,—a
countryman who has driven in with his milk-cart
through the chill light of a London dawn.
All the pride and struggle of the past is written
on her once lovely face, and she shrinks in shame
and terror from his touch.</p>

  </div>

<p class='c017'>A more original and striking composition is “Hesterna

this painfully impressive design;—mediæval
in spirit, and yet almost Hogarthian in its bold
handling of human degradation and debauchery.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>The motive is taken from “Elena’s Song” in Sir

<p class='c017'>The scene is in a tent at early daybreak, amid a
group of gamblers and depraved women throwing
dice. But one of them is a girl still beautiful, and
not yet hardened by the coarseness of her new
life. She shrinks from the kiss of the player who
bends over her hand. “Yesterday’s Rose” is not
wholly faded; only her first fresh bloom is gone;
she has bartered it irretrievably for her chance in
the desperate game of passion, like the vengeful
woman in “The Laboratory,” offering her pearls
to buy poison for her enemy. The contrast between
the shamed “rose” and her brutalized companions
is emphasized by the tender light of the
dawn, which creeps through the orchard trees
outside, and makes the lamp within appear more
yellow and dull and weak.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Entirely modern in spirit and execution is
Holman Hunt’s treatment of a similar theme.
The “Awakening Conscience” is that of a girl
idling with her paramour in a newly and luxuriously
furnished room. He has been singing to
her, not noticing the change in her face, and his
hands still pass carelessly over the pianoforte keys.
But the words of the song—Moore’s “Oft in the
Stilly Night”—have stirred a sudden anguish in her
heart; she has started up, tortured with long pent
memories and overcome with shame and despair.
The utter falsity of her new surroundings seems
to strike her as she gazes round the cruelly unhomelike
home. A terrible symbolism confronts
her on every side; the showy tapestry is woven
with a design of ripe corn on which the carrion birds
are feeding; the picture hanging above the mantelpiece
represents the woman taken in adultery. The
tragic intensity of the painting is hardly surpassed
by any other of the artist’s work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Far back in the golden ages of classic myth, the
ever-significant story of “Psyche” <a id='corr239'></a><ins class='correction' title='suggest'>suggests</ins> the same
stern lesson,—of the irretrievable loss which comes
by violation of the moral law or disobedience to
the dicta of those “gods” by which the men of old
time knew the divine and imperative instincts of
the soul. The fall of Psyche has its message for
to-day. It was made known to her that the god
Eros should come to earth to be her husband. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>the darkness of the night he should visit her bed,
and there he should vouchsafe to her the sacrament
of his love,—but on one condition: that she should
never seek to look upon his face, or lift the veil of
mystery by which Nature shrouded the sanctities
of the godhead from her eyes. But Psyche’s
curiosity overcame her reverence and trustfulness.
In her eagerness to know Love’s sacred secrets
and lay bare the holiest of holies upon earth, she
took a lamp, and would have looked boldly at her
visitant. But immediately the spell was broken;
the heavenly Eros fled from her, never to return.
The widowed Psyche, in Mr. Watts’s picture,
stands ashamed and broken-hearted, knowing too
late the prize that she has forfeited. Her drooping
figure is the embodiment of dazed remorse.
She has dared to trifle with the divinest things,
to be familiar with that which is rare, to probe too
curiously into the mystic borderland between earth
and heaven. The devout sense of the limitations
of man’s knowledge, and of the penalty attaching
to any impious familiarity with the supernatural
world, has thus its roots in Hellenism, but attains
its finest flower in the spirit of romance. It is the
blending of the sensuous dignity of classicism with
the subtle tenderness of romance that gives so fine
a pathos to this poor “Psyche,”—typical as she is
of the modern age, mourning the lost mystery
which its own thirst for knowledge at all hazards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>has dispelled; or again, that places Rossetti’s
“Pandora” and “Proserpine” in the highest rank
of contemporary art. For Proserpine too has
eaten the forbidden fruit of the lower knowledge,
whereby the higher wisdom is driven away. She
has eaten one grain of the fatal pomegranate of
Hades, which enchains her to the lower world;
and only at rare seasons can her sullied spirit
attain the upper air. Her troubled face, as she
stands in the picture, in a gloomy corridor of her
prison-palace, with the broken fruit in her hand,
seems to tell of the long struggle of a soul that,
having once tasted the coarser joys, has become
less sensitive to the higher, and is torn between
the baser enchantment and the pure delights which
it longs to regain. A critic already quoted<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a> has
pointed out that there is “always in Rossetti’s
women the kind of sorrow that ennobles affection.”
The painter never loses the sense of conflict between
the dangers of the physical nature and the
glories of the spirit which it serves. The sorrow
of his great “Pandora,” even more than of the
beautiful “Proserpine,” is the sorrow of a goddess
over her own infirmity. She has opened the
mystic casket which she was bidden to keep
sealed, and now she stands helpless before the
witness of her deed. The potent spirits are escaping
from the box, and she can never undo the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>mischief she has done. “The whole design,” says
Mr. Swinburne, “is among Rossetti’s mightiest in
its godlike terror and imperial trouble of beauty,
shadowed by the smoke and fiery vapour of winged
and fleshless passions crowding from the casket in
spires of flame-lit and curling cloud round her
fatal face and mourning veil of hair.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It follows, then, that the earnest apprehension
of the spiritual sphere, and of a divine justice and
retribution for sin, will give a special power and
reality to pictures dealing with a crisis of duty, or
a moment of choice between martyrdom and sin.
Such a choice, such a responsibility, is the motive
of some of the finest work of Millais’s transition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>period,—“The Hugenot,” “The Proscribed Royalist,”
“The Rescue,” and “The Black Brunswicker.”
“The Hugenot” is probably the most popular, as
it is the most perfect, of the painter’s earlier masterpieces.
The story which it tells is explained in
its full title: “A Hugenot, on St. Bartholomew’s
Day, refusing to shield himself from danger by
wearing the Roman Catholic badge.” “When the
clock of the Palais de Justice shall sound upon the
great bell at daybreak” (so ran the order of the
Duke of Guise), “then each good Catholic must
bind a strip of white linen round his arm, and
place a fair white cross in his cap.” A Catholic
lady is beseeching her Protestant lover to wear
the white scarf which will preserve him from the
coming massacre. Her beautiful face is drawn
with anxious terror as she tries to bind the kerchief
round his arm, but he, embracing her, draws
it resolutely away; the mental struggle is not his,
but hers; in spite of the tenderness of his face,
there is a certain sternness and solemnity in it
which tells that nothing will move him from his
purpose; that he is ready, and gladly ready, for
martyrdom. The girl’s love pleads vainly against
his duty and his doom. In “The Black Brunswicker,”
which formed the pendant to “The
Hugenot,” the same drama of conflicting love and
duty is set forth, though with less convincing
fervour and exalted passion than before. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>lady seems to be of French family, and is somewhat
pettishly delaying the departure of her lover,
an officer of the Black Brunswick corps, before
the Battle of Waterloo. The converse of the
choice of man and woman between disloyalty and
death is nobly given us by Holman Hunt in
his “Claudio and Isabella” (from Shakespeare’s
“Measure for Measure”), where the heroism and
the devotion lie on the woman’s side. Claudio
has been condemned to death, and his sister’s
honour is asked as the price of his release. She
visits him in prison, clad in her nun’s garb, and
Claudio—the human craving for life conquering
for the moment his better nature, cries out in a
half shamed appeal, “O Isabel, ... death is a
fearful thing.” But Isabella, standing before him,
pressing her hands against his heart, her face full
of pity and distress, gives back her resolute answer,
“And shaméd life a hateful!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Together with the conception of duty in its
relation to romantic love is linked the ideal of
chivalry,—of the immediate glory of duty and its
supreme rewards, especially when exercised in
championship of the weak, of a defenceless foe, or of
womanhood. The splendour of physical courage
tends always to give place to the power of moral
courage, as in mercy and forgiveness rather than
in revenge; or if the physical courage be brought
into play, it will, in progress of civilization be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>applied to deeds of helpfulness instead of cruelty.
The nobility of true knighthood, which Rossetti
conceived almost exclusively in the mediæval
spirit, and presented with exquisite verve and
passion in his little sketches of “St. George” and
the “Princess Sabra,” and of which the converse—the
potential knightliness of woman—was suggested
both by Rossetti and Millais in their “Joan
of Arc” designs, finds full expression in the latter’s
picture of “Sir Isumbras at the Ford.” An aged
knight, clad in splendid armour, and bearing with
courtly dignity his honours and his years, is fording
a river on his war-horse, and pauses to lift up
two little peasant children who have asked him to
carry them to the other side. The simple graciousness
and humility of the act seem to transfigure
the old warrior’s face, which is further lit by the
rich light of the landscape in the setting sun. By
the side of this great painting should be set the
earlier, but in great measure the companion work,
“The Rescue,” in which the same artist translates
the thought of beneficent chivalry into modern and
familiar life. For the knight of “The Rescue” is a
London fireman, in the act of saving three children
from a burning house. The light that suffuses his
calmly heroic face is not the natural radiance of a
sunset glow, but the fierce glare of flames around the
staircase, down which he brings his precious burden
safe and sound. “The Rescue” is a poem of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>modern chivalry in a great crisis: “Sir Isumbras”
celebrates mediæval chivalry in common things.
The strong self-possession of the fireman in the
midst of imminent peril, beset on all sides by heat,
smoke, water, and burning brands, not callous or
insensible to fear, but superior to it, gives us, as it
were, the other side of that perfect knighthood
suggested by the simple kindness of “Sir Isumbras
at the Ford.” In both these pictures, as indeed in
“The Hugenot” and in Hunt’s “Claudio and
Isabella,” the impression conveyed is not merely
of a momentary heroism of choice or deed, but of
the long discipline which must have gone to produce
it, and of what all goodness costs to the life
and lives behind it. It is in these aspects that the
Pre-Raphaelites portray, as we have already contended,
not merely action but character; not
drama only, but the hidden forces of human struggle
and circumstance which give the drama its meaning
for all time.</p>

<p class='c000'>But great as are these pictures in thought and
emotion, excellent as are most of them in technical
quality, they are even surpassed, in the sheer
passion of romantic worship, in the purest essence
of religious chivalry, by one of the earliest and,
technically, crudest paintings of Burne-Jones in
what may fairly be called his Rossettian period.
“The Merciful Knight” stands apart, in its desperate
realism, its mystic exaltation and fervour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>its emotional abandonment, from all the ethereal
and chastened ideals of his imaginative maturity.
It represents a phase of feeling very transitory, for
the most part, with the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood,—a
return to the most devout and ascetic
mediævalism, untempered by the larger Hellenic
spirit which re-awoke in modern romance. And,
full charged as it is with the inspiration of Rossetti
in drawing and colour, its religious severity links
it rather to the manner of Holman Hunt. It tells
the story “of a knight who forgave his enemy
when he might have destroyed him, and how the
image of Christ kissed him, in token that his acts
had pleased God.” Low at a wayside shrine
bends the Merciful Knight, prostrated by the
spiritual struggle between magnanimity and vengeance
which he has just passed through. And as
he kneels in mingled prayer and thankfulness over
his own self-conquest and moral victory, the image
of Christ, rudely carved and hanging on a simple
cross, bends down, miraculously moved, to kiss his
cheek. Rarely if ever have the Pre-Raphaelite
painters surpassed in any field the emotional
power of this great design. The conflict between
loyalty to a cause and charity towards its fallen
enemy was for some years a favourite subject with
the Pre-Raphaelites of every grade. It yielded
the motive, for instance, of Millais’s “Proscribed
Royalist,” in which a Puritan lady secretly conveys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>food to her lover, a Cavalier, who is in hiding in a
woodland oak; of W.S. Burton’s “Puritan,” where
the austere lady, walking with her lover, takes
pity on a dying Cavalier, wounded by Roundhead
soldiers in a wood; and of W.L. Windus’s “Outlaw,”
similarly hurt and tended in an equally
sylvan scene. But in none of these cases is the
spiritual struggle of the ministering visitant portrayed
with an intensity at all to be compared with
the exalted passion that dominates “The Merciful
Knight.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Such are the principal stages of thought and
feeling through which the Pre-Raphaelite painters
pass—in no given order indeed, but with a wholly
intelligible sequence of ideas—from the first
impulses of romance—the apprehension of the
supernatural, of the mystery of fate, of the moral
order, and the divine possibilities of human life—to
that highest idealism of romantic love, and of its
power over death and destiny, which we find in
their interpretation of Keats’s “Eve of St. Agnes,”
and supremely in Rossetti’s imaginative treatment
of the love of Dante for Beatrice. Something of
the mystical glory of a pure and lofty passion, and
of the power of perfect womanhood to raise, as in
Keats’s poem, the earthlier elements of love into
the very essence of worship, appears in Hunt’s
early picture, “The Flight of Madeline and
Porphyro,” and in the triptych of “The Eve of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>St. Agnes,” by Arthur Hughes; but its most
complete expression, apart from Rossetti, must be
sought in Millais’s “St. Agnes’ Eve,”—in the
opinion of many, the greatest of his paintings;
the consummation of that wonderful aftermath of
poetic genius which followed a full decade later
than what seemed to be his prime. For the beauty
of Madeline, by a significant paradox, is that she is
not beautiful. Her attitude is daringly simple;
she is standing by her bed in the moonlight, half-unclad;
her gown has slipped from her waist to
her feet, and the keen, silver-blue rays creep softly
about her slender figure and shed a faint light into
the foreground of the deep-shadowed room. Yet
with all the mellow tenderness of colour and
atmosphere that wrap her round, there is in no
detail of her form or gesture, or the aspect of her
averted face, the slightest appeal to the sensuous
possibilities of the scene. There is about her an
extraordinary spiritual loveliness, born of the utter
artlessness and sincerity of her pose and the girlish
innocence of her look, as if the absolute naturalness
of the situation were its own protection from
all thought of ill. Everything around her speaks
of her simple holiness and purity, and seals, as it
were, the pledge of the answering purity of
Porphyro’s love.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it is in the presence of the greatest romantic
passion known to European poetry—the ideal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>immortal love of Dante for Beatrice—that Pre-Raphaelite
painting reaches, in the art of Rossetti,
the acme of its power to transfigure and interpret
the highest experiences of the human soul. With
the most chastened symbolism, the finest selectiveness
of design and colouring, the loftiest fervour
of thought and expression, Rossetti unfolds to
us the inmost glories of Platonic love, as Dante
knew it, and Michaelangelo; and as our own age
vaguely but with increasing aspiration seeks it
through many an error and much pain. He
leads us in imagination through the sacred
course of that all-embracing worship which upheld
the soul of Dante through every vicissitude
of toil and trial, from the first hour in which the
smile of the Blessed Beatrice made the boy’s
heart tremble for joy, until the solemn moment of
resignation when “it was made known to him that
his beloved Lady must die.” Again and again
did Rossetti attempt the unwearying subject of
“The Salutation of Beatrice.” The most important
that remain to us of those efforts, which in
one medium or another cover nearly the whole of
his artistic career, are the early water-colour
sketches in which the scene of the fateful meeting
is laid in the portico of a church; the diptych
showing in one compartment Beatrice saluting
Dante in a street in Florence, while in the other
she appears to him in a field of lilies in Paradise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>(“Il Purgatorio,” canto 30); the triptych repeating
the same designs, but having in the centre panel a
figure of Love holding a dial whereon is marked
the date (June 9, 1290) of the salutation; and a
much later version in single form, representing
Beatrice, walking alone in Florence, within sight
of Dante, but watched over by the guardian figure
of Love, with crimson robe and wings. Of these
works, the triptych is perhaps the most perfect.
The left compartment is inscribed with Dante’s
words, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“E cui saluta fà tremar lo core,”</span> and the
right with those of the salutation in Paradise,
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">“Guardami ben; ben son, ben son Beatrice”</span>
(“Behold and see if I am truly Beatrice”).</p>

<p class='c000'>Again we see the gracious lady passing before the
eyes of her young lover in a procession through the
chapel at Bargello, while above her is depicted
“Giotto painting the portrait of Dante,”—a portrait
actually discovered five centuries later on the chapel
wall. Once more, Rossetti pictures Beatrice embarking
with Dante in “The Boat of Love.” The
motive of this work is taken from Dante’s sonnet to
Guido Calvacanti, his poet-friend (who figures,
together with Cimabue, the master of Giotto, in
the sketch above mentioned), beginning:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Guido, I would that Lapo, thou, and I</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Were taken by some skilled enchanted spell,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And placed on board a barque that should speed well</div>
      <div class='line'>Through wind and wave, and with our will comply.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>With reverent humility and tenderness Dante is
leading Beatrice into the enchanted boat of which
he dreamed. She yields her hands to him and
seems to pause beneath his earnest gaze as she
steps down. Around her are the companions of
their voyage,—Guido Calvacanti with his lady
Giovanna, also known as Primavera, and Lapo
degli Uberti and his love.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Beata Beatrix,”—“The Blessed Beatrice,”—depicts,
not the actual death of Dante’s beloved,
but rather a mystic trance in which is made known
to her the nearness of her end. She sits on a
balcony overlooking the city of Florence, which is
already shadowed by the coming loss. Before her
is a sundial, marking the fatal hour. A dove,
flying into her lap, carries a poppy-blossom, the
symbol of sleep. The lovely face of Beatrice is
upturned, as if to greet the unseen messenger,
and full of perfect peace. She seems to have
attained the sight of blessedness, and to be yielding
her spirit to a deep and sweet content, but the
earthly weariness lingers about her brows and on
her pale and parted lips. In the background,
Dante and the figure of Love are seen passing in
the street below. Love holds a flaming heart in
his hands, and they both gaze in grief and awe at
the rapt countenance which the dignity of the
coming death suffuses with exquisite pathos and
transcendent charm. In the features of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>Beatrice, more than in any other, Rossetti has regained
and embodied the thought that found superlative
expression in Michaelangelo,—“the notion
of <em>inspired</em> sleep, of faces charged with dreams.”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A more familiar passage from the “Vita Nuova”
is illustrated by the largest, and in many respects
the finest, of Rossetti’s completed pictures, “Dante’s
Dream;” dealing with the poet’s record of the
vision in which “it was revealed to him that the
Lord God of Justice had called his most gracious
lady unto Himself.” “Then feeling bewildered,”
says Dante, writing of that strange experience,
which occurred to him at the age of twenty-five, “I
closed mine eyes, and my brain began to be in
travail, as the brain of one frantic. And I seemed
to look toward Heaven, and to behold a multitude
of angels who were returning upwards, having before
them an exceedingly white cloud. Then my
heart, that was so full of love, said unto me, ‘It is
true that our lady lieth dead;’ and it seemed to
me that I went to look upon the body wherein
that blessed and most noble spirit had had its
abiding place. And so strong was this idle imagining
that it made me to behold my lady in death;
whose head certain ladies seemed to be covering
with a white veil, and who was so humble of her
aspect that it was as though she had said, ‘I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>attained to look on the beginning of peace.’” On
a red-draped couch in the chamber of death
lies the Blessed Beatrice, clad in white robes,
her hands folded on her bosom, and her bright
hair spread about her pillow. Her maidens,
at her head and feet, are hanging over her a
purple pall, filled with May-blossoms, the emblem
of the spring-time of her life, in which she died.
The floor is strewn with poppies, symbolizing
again the sleep in which she takes her unbroken
rest; and on the frieze above are roses and violets,
suggestive of the beauty and purity of the departed
soul. Over the couch hangs a lamp, glimmering
with a fast-expiring flame; and high up in air,
through an opening in the roof, is seen a flight of
angels, garbed in the deep red of a damask rose,—symbolic
of the Platonic love which should immortalize
the beloved in the sight of all men,—and bearing
the white cloud that represents the life that has fled.
The crimson doves, of which Rossetti made his
constant symbol of heavenly ministries, flutter up
and down the staircases on either side of the room.
Before the couch stands the figure of Love, with
his flame-coloured robes fastened at the shoulder
by a scallop-shell, signifying pilgrimage. In one
hand he holds a winged arrow—his weapon for
the heart—and a bunch of rosemary; with the
other he leads Dante, who, clad in the black garb
of mourning, tinged with the purple of consecration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>advances as if in a dream, and shrinks, dazed
and awed, before the beauty of the dead Beatrice.
And Love, still holding Dante by the hand, bends
forward and kisses the face of the beloved, thus
making himself the mediator between Dante and
Beatrice, and the reconciler of life with death. It
is as though the poet’s life-long worship were
summed up and presented at the gate of heaven by
a higher power than his own, and a benediction
wrested for him, by the very humility and devoutness
of his passion, from the glorified spirit beyond
the grave. The dominant note of the design is
one of resignation and hope; the passionate,
strenuous, mystical resignation which Platonism
brought into Christianity at the dawn of the
Renaissance, and hope, born of the quickened fervour
and resolution of romantic love.</p>

<p class='c000'>In two notable subjects Rossetti deals with
incidents recorded by Dante of himself after the
death of Beatrice. In a early water-colour of
singular dignity and elevation of feeling, he celebrates
“The Anniversary of the Death of Beatrice.”
“On that day,” says Dante in the “Vita Nuova,”
“which completed the year since my lady had been
made of the citizens of eternal life, I was sitting in
a place apart, where, remembering me of her, I
was drawing an angel upon certain tablets; and as
I drew, I turned my eyes, and saw beside me
persons to whom it was fitting to do honour, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>who were looking at what I did: and according as
it was told me afterwards, they had been there
awhile before I perceived them. Then I arose
for salutation and said, ‘Another was present with
me.’” The poet, kneeling at a window overlooking
the Arno, absorbed in his memorial task, has
suddenly become conscious of his visitors, and is
overwhelmed with delicate pride and shame.</p>

</div>

<p class='c005'>Again, among the latest of Rossetti’s unfinished
works, we have the illustration of another passage
in the “Vita Nuova,” telling of Dante’s mourning
for his lady’s death. “La Donna della Finestra”
(“The Lady of the Window”), better known as
“Our Lady of Pity,” represents the beautiful woman
who looked down on Dante from a window
when, as he passed weeping through the streets,
and fearing lest the passers-by should mock him,
he glanced up, craving for some sign of sympathy,
and was consoled by her calm and pitying gaze.
Sketches for this design were made in several
media, but the head in the unfinished painting at
Birmingham is the most perfect of the series, and
in fact ranks among the finest of the female heads
in all Rossetti’s single-figure pictures. The artist
has caught with rare felicity the expression so
acutely described by the poet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>Her eyes directed towards me with that look</div>
      <div class='line'>A mother casts on a delirious child.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>All the depth, all the tenderness, all the heroic
strength of a divine sorrow that sees the end of
sorrow, shines in this full-souled face. It is the
ideal of the highest womanhood, and indeed of the
highest humanity; of the love that has attained to
be godlike, redeeming the world by infinite compassion;
a love that “hopeth all things and
endureth all things,” and in whose steadfast courage
lies the conquering principle of the life to be.
It is the companion picture—and in some respects
it is a nobler, healthier version—of “The Blessed
Damozel,” leaning from the bar of heaven to console
the mourner on the earth below. The love
that can so take hold of immortality, bring comfort
even from the gates of death, and bridge over,
by the sweet persistence of its ministry, by the
passionate reality of its inspiration, the gulf between
the physical and the spiritual world, is the
love which of old was the source of the “Vita
Nuova,” and which springs anew in our own age
through “Our Lady of Pity” and “The Blessed
Damozel.” In such designs Rossetti has restored
to us all that was best in the mediæval thought of
womanhood,—adding the “ever-motherly” to the
“ever-womanly” of the Hellenic model, and the
Divine Motherhood to the Divine Fatherhood of
the Christian ideal; and enriched it with the whole
wealth of psycho-sensuous beauty brought over
from the region of romance. And in this consummation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>is justified the verdict of Ruskin: that
“Rossetti was the chief intellectual force in the
establishment of the modern romantic school in
England.”</p>

of Rossetti’s Poetry to his Painting.</p>

<p class='c005'>The poetry of Dante Gabriel Rossetti lies
apart from the main current of contemporary
verse, both in its highly specialized
quality of thought and language, and in the
conditions and circumstances of its production.
Inasmuch as he followed openly the profession of
a painter, pursuing poetry, for the most part, as
a recreative rather than a principal study (though
never with less seriousness than his accepted vocation),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>and publishing his first volume of original
poems in his forty-second year, he is exempt to
some extent from the standards of criticism applied
to him whose creative energies are concentrated in
the field of literature. Whether Rossetti’s genius,
as he himself believed, found its highest and most
perfect embodiment in poetry rather than in painting,—whether
the essential qualities of his art will
be more evident to posterity in the modest volume
of his collected poems than in the pictures now
dispersed through England and America—is still
an open question. It may, however, be admitted
that his mastery of the verbal medium was almost
always more complete, his discipline in metrical
structure more thorough, and his natural habit
of diction more facile, than any skill which he
attained in brush and pencil. To estimate his
final influence upon contemporary thought in the
one realm as against the other is yet more difficult
than to assess the relative merit of his actual work
in either sphere: so intimately was the poet incarnate
in the painter; so largely did the painter’s
vision inspire and dominate the poet.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it would be a poor analysis that should
divide too finely the interwoven threads of a
radiant and many-coloured genius. In an age of
intellectual re-birth, of artistic and social revolution,
the re-adjustment of forces and functions in
the ethical and æsthetical realms is apt to produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>a strange complexity of talent, not always beneficial
to a single art, not always well for the
diversely endowed artist, but often tending to the
unification of many activities into one effective
stream of purpose, moved by the impulse that
infused the nation with a Time-Spirit potent for
immortal things. Such a combination of talent in
single personalities, in a period of rare national
fertility in scholarship and creative power, reveals
at the same time the basic unity of the æsthetic
life and its inseparable interdependence with the
moral ideal. Michaelangelo, at the zenith of the
Italian Renaissance, standing at the parting of the
ways, gathered up, as it seemed, the several arts
into his representative genius, and left to the land
that was soon to swamp the æsthetic spirit in the
mire of a materialistic decadence the threefold
heritage of his painting, his sculpture, and his
song. Rossetti, at the zenith of the English
Renaissance, drew a twofold inspiration from
the struggle of the modern world, and left the
double dower of painting and of poetry, to urge
the coming generation to the higher issues of fine
art, or to stand, the witness of rejected ideals to
ages recalcitrant to the vision and the impulse of
to-day.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the first greatness of Rossetti’s poetry is
that it assumes for ever the reality and the immanence
of a spiritual—and more—a moral world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Not that he ever misuses the vehicles of art as
tools of philosophy, or stoops to a didactic application
of æsthetic truth. But his art is all moral
(as Mr. Ruskin would put it) because it is all fine
art. And the moral purpose of art is the better
secured when art is trusted to effect that purpose
in its own way. The consciously didactic poet is
less sure to mould the will and character of a
people, than he the form and substance of whose
utterance are so perfected in truth and virility of
thought, in majesty and grace of speech, as to be
a fit oblation to his own ideal. Not “how can I
best teach others and influence them aright?” but
“how can I best express the highest things I know
and feel?” is the self-examination of the true artist.
Rossetti’s poetry is self-expressive, self-revealing
to the very heart’s core. The ultimate test of
poetry is not “what did this man intend to teach
us?” but “of what sort is the manhood here revealed?
what are the visions by which it lived?
what the ideals in which it grew? Is such a soul’s
experience wide, deep, typical, and profitable to
the rest of mankind?”</p>

<p class='c000'>In applying such a test to the writings of
Rossetti, it is necessary to distinguish between
what may be roughly termed the “personal”
and the “impersonal” poems. In the one class,
supremely exemplified by the “House of Life”
sonnets, but including also “Dante at Verona,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>“The Stream’s Secret,” “The Portrait,” and
many of the shorter lyrics, the personal note of
love or grief, of memory or hope, is wholly
dominant; the poet’s soul is absorbed with its
individual being, and sees in all the life around
him the illustration and interpretation of his own.
In the other class, in the great romantic ballads,
in “Rose Mary” and “The Blessed Damozel,” in
“The White Ship” and “The King’s Tragedy,”
in “The Bride’s Prelude” and “Sister Helen,”
the imagination takes a higher and a larger
range; the one soul interprets others, waiting
not to be interpreted. The art becomes impersonal
in this sense only—that the thought of
self is merged in the full and immense life of
humanity, laying hold of the universal consciousness
through its own initiative experience; the
heart beats with the world’s heart, shares its
eternal struggles, contributes to its eternal growth;
and the spirit knows itself one fragment of an infinite
whole. In such a sphere the art remains
the more vitally personal, in that the poet brings
the mysteries of existence, the abiding problems
and realities of the conscious world, to the touchstone,
as it were, of his own spirit, and submits
himself thereby to the more crucial test,—of how
he can interpret humanity to man, and make more
clear the knowledge, more possible the realization,
of his highest ideals.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>With this general division of the subject-matter
of Rossetti’s poetry, the classification of its metrical
cast and forms of diction will be singularly parallel.
Most of his finest compositions might be distinguished
as purely Saxon or pre-eminently Latin
poems; and it is notable that the more intimately
subjective and analytic the thought within, the
more persistently does it assume the Latin garb;
while as the imagination ranges from the introspection
of the hyper-conscious self, and finds, on
the heights of common human feeling and aspiration,
a larger and a freer air, the mode passes into
the more keen and rarified Saxon speech. No
other English poet has resolved the breadth and
simplicity of the Gothic, and the depth and intensity
of the Italian habit of expression, into such
distinctive poetic vehicles. But at the same time
few have blended the diverse elements of the
modern English tongue into the harmony and
sonority with which Rossetti’s music thrills when
he tempers the sharper Saxon with a deep undertone
of polysyllabic song; or stirs the languorous
pulses of a sonnet with some swift cadence of
familiar words. He had the finest perception of
national and racial properties of form and rhythm;
and discerning the characteristics of the poetry of
action in the literature of the north, and the poetry
of reflection in the literature of the south, he cast
his great historical lyrics in the highest narrative—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>is to say, the ballad form; and chose the
sonnet—the most remote, chastened, and exclusive
vehicle—for the meditative, and yet sensuous, self-delineative
love-poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>These broad generalizations, however, cannot
be closely pressed upon the entire sequence of
Rossetti’s poems. The exigencies of the English
language alone elude their literal application. They
will rather serve to illustrate the duality of his endowments,
and the singular power of his genius
both to conserve and specialize the characteristics
of his Italian heritage, and also to waive them in
the Saxon mode as utterly as though the latter
were more native to his tongue.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor does such a superficial distinction affect the
spiritual qualities which pervade Rossetti’s poetry
as a whole. From first to last, in dramatic
description or narrative, in sonnet-argument or
meditative questioning, his verse remains full-charged
with the very essence of romance. As a
poet, he is neither less nor more Pre-Raphaelite
than as a painter. The vivid and intense simplicity
of his Saxon diction, the verbal lightnings
of his ballad-style, seem to correspond with the
tone and method of his water-colour painting,
and the more laboured splendour of the sonnets
with the properties of his work in oils. Nor is it
difficult to detect an analogy between that stage
of his painting in which the pristine lucidity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>expression was partially lost in the painful tension
of his later thought, and the tendency of some few
of his sonnets towards decadence into the over-laborious
and the obscure. Yet if by “Pre-Raphaelite”
we understand that fusion of the
naïve mysticism of romance with austere Platonic
Hellenism which we discern in the best Renaissance
art, Rossetti never falls in spirit from that
standard of beauty and truth; and rarely lapses,
through the very richness and fecundity of the
language at his command, into the redundant
verbiage towards which his sensuous imagery was
easily led. It has remained for a brother-poet of
the romantic revival to cultivate a more marvellous
dexterity of rhyme and rhythm, and to develop the
technical resources of our language to the utmost
limits of intelligible song. The lyrics of Mr. Swinburne,
like the superb decorative extravagances of
the later Renaissance, represent that culmination
of mastery over the forms of expression wherein
to-day, as of yore, the purity of the thought is lost
in the splendour of the setting, and poetic power
wastes itself in a magic facility of verse.</p>

<p class='c000'>The poetry of Rossetti, modern as it is in its
passionate grasp of human interests, its deep insight
into present and perpetual things, links itself
nevertheless to an English past; takes up, as it
were, the dropped threads of Elizabethan glory;
re-inspires the circling breath of life which passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>round Europe in the fifteenth century, kindling
England from the fires of re-awakened Italy in the
golden age of song. It has already been pointed
out by one of Rossetti’s biographers that “the
malign influence over our literature in post-Shakespearean
times has been French.” It was reserved
for a second Renaissance, heralded by Chatterton
and Blake, led by Shelley, Keats, and Coleridge,
and culminated by Dante Rossetti, to blot out two
centuries of foreign tradition and control, and take
us back to the broad simplicity and dignity of
Shakespeare’s England.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our reiteration, therefore, of the term “Pre-Raphaelite”
in approaching Rossetti’s work as a
poet, leads us to expect, not mysticism merely, but
a certain robust sensuousness, as of Pagan origin,
in his interpretation of life and destiny. The
romantic temper in its highest manifestations, absorbing
and transfiguring, rather than conflicting
with, the classic ideals, implies much more than
receptivity to newer beauty and truth. It has a
moral basis and an intellectual range: it apprehends
the spiritual world as something closely
bound up with familiar things: it finds the human
soul striving for expression through material forms:
it recognizes the divine possibilities of individual
and social life, the force and responsibility of personal
character, and the solemnity of the choice
between good and evil daily made by man.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>But the controversy excited by Rossetti’s pictures
has been neither more intemperate nor more
significant than that which has raged around his
poems;—interpreted by one section of his critics as
a pæan of sensuality and materialism, by another
as the most spiritual and chastened love-poetry of
the age. The laureate of the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood indeed summed up, in what now
affords but one volume of original verse, the inmost
vicissitudes of a spirit so rare and rich of
vision as to transcend at once the canons of conventional
experience. But the personal note, in
the self-delineative poems, is struck with a peculiar
dignity of reserve; and even while the most sacred
depths of individual consciousness are laid bare,
the actual <em>ego</em> is never intruded upon the surface
of the speech,—never portrays directly its own
character, seldom describes its own sensations as
Byron or Shelley would; but veils itself, even in
the profusion of luminous imagery and searching
analysis of thought and sense.</p>

<p class='c000'>The eternal mysteries and sanctities of sexual
love, conceived in its highest aspects and known
as a revelation and a sacrament, afford the theme
of nearly all Rossetti’s autobiographic poetry. The
conditions of its production were ordained by the
stern fate that linked him afar off to Dante among
his countrymen, and near at hand to two brother-mourners
among minor English bards—James
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Thomson and Philip Bourke Marston—in the sad
fraternity of poets whom death has prematurely
robbed of the beloved object that once inspired
their song. The exalted spirituality which marks
Rossetti’s treatment of this theme was doubtless
largely due to the influence of Dante, and especially
to the fruitful inspiration and discipline of the great
literary task of his youth—the translation of the
“Vita Nuova” and kindred examples of the early
Italian poets—than which Rossetti could have
hardly found a better preparation for his work that
was to come.</p>

<p class='c000'>Into his great sonnet-sequence, “The House of
Life,” Rossetti poured the full passion of his
mystic love,—partially inherent in his own sensuous,
imaginative, and introspective nature, partially
instilled at the feet of Dante; and learned—a
bitter and a costly lesson—at the school of
experience also; fraught with inestimable joy and
sorrow to his own soul. “At an age,” says one
writing of that hard probation, “when most men
have outlived the romances of their youth, Rossetti
was laying, in ‘The House of Life,’ the foundations
of a new school of love-poetry.” He was in
fact re-creating the æsthetic life of a nation; restoring
to it, through the alembic of mediæval and
Renaissance thought, the lost glory of all that was
abidingly precious in the Platonic world. For in
this wondrous cycle of sonnets is re-coined the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>whole language of ideal love. From the last echo
of the “Vita Nuova” it takes up the same pure
strain, and sings again the song of Dante for the
Blessed Beatrice; hymning the very apotheosis of
spiritual passion, and harmonizing once more in
English poetry the intellectual with the sensuous
world. Never, in the superb visions of “The
House of Life”—in which the soul of man is
pictured sojourning awhile during its solemn and
fateful passage through eternity—never does the
physical love become the stumbling-block to the
spiritual, but always the key to it. The “body’s
beauty” is only precious as the witness of the
“soul’s beauty;” the physical bond is nothing if
not the symbol of a spiritual affinity, a sacred
kinship, fore-ordained, if not eternal, sealed in
Heaven and consecrated to the divinest purposes;
the sensuous rapture is but a symbolic worship,—“the
outward and visible sign of an inward and
spiritual grace” which to reject or betray is to
profane the inmost sanctuary of the God of Love:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Even so, when first I saw you, seemed it, love,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That among souls allied to mine was yet</div>
      <div class='line'>One nearer kindred than life hinted of.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>O born with me somewhere that men forget,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And though in years of sight and sound unmet,</div>
      <div class='line'>Known for my soul’s birth-partner well enough!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Love the revealer of unseen verities, the binder
of invisible bonds; Love the deliverer from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>material trammels, the opener of the gate of life;
these are to him the gracious manifestations of
the same deity:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O what from thee the grace, to me the prize,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And what to Love the glory,—when the whole</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Of the deep stair thou tread’st to the dim shoal</div>
      <div class='line'>And weary water of the place of sighs,</div>
      <div class='line'>And there dost work deliverance, as thine eyes</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Draw up my prisoned spirit to thy soul!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the large atmosphere of such a worship,
seeing all things, as we have said, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>sub specie
eternitatis</em></span>, the poet portrays the sweetest intimacies
of communion, soul with soul; questioning,
recording, comparing from time to time the
recurring phases of joy and hope, memory and
regret. “When do I see thee most?” he asks in
the exquisite sonnet called “Lovesight”:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When do I see thee most, beloved one?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>When in the light the spirits of mine eyes</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Before thy face, their altar, solemnize</div>
      <div class='line'>The worship of that love through thee made known?</div>
      <div class='line'>Or when in the dusk hours, (we two alone,)</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Close-kissed and eloquent of still replies</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thy twilight-hidden glimmering visage lies,</div>
      <div class='line'>And my soul only sees thy soul its own?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>“What of her glass without her?” he cries
again after the great bereavement which has
removed the visible presence of the beloved:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>“What of her glass without her? The blank grey</div>
      <div class='line in2'>There where the pool is blind of the moon’s face.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her dress without her? The tossed empty space</div>
      <div class='line'>Of cloud-rack whence the moon has passed away.</div>
      <div class='line'>Her paths without her? Day’s appointed sway</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Usurped by desolate night. Her pillowed place</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Without her? Tears, ah me! for love’s good grace,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cold forgetfulness of night or day.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And with what fine insight does Rossetti pierce
the tender subtleties of the woman’s responsive
heart! Has any other English poet discerned so
well that retrospective instinct which clings to the
early semblances of pure and non-sexual love?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>—“She loves him, for her infinite soul is love.</div>
      <div class='line'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>
      <div class='line in18'>With wifely breast to breast</div>
      <div class='line'>And circling arms, she welcomes all command</div>
      <div class='line'>Of love,—her soul to answering ardours fanned:</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet as morn springs or twilight sinks to rest,</div>
      <div class='line'><em>Ah! who shall say she deems not loveliest</em></div>
      <div class='line in2'><em>The hour of sisterly sweet hand-in-hand?</em>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In that hint lies the acknowledgment of the
Platonic ideal,—that whatever dignifies and ennobles
the affections must lie not in the outward
conditions but within; that the senses are but
the accessories of Love; the temporary channels,
not the eternal stream. And this insistence on
the spiritual aspects of passion affects the whole
tone and temper of Rossetti’s poetry; raising it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>in moments of intense feeling, almost to the mystic
exaltation of a Pascal, and transfiguring all the
world of consciousness by the knowledge and
memory of an overmastering love. From the
first to the last of the hundred sonnets we are
shown steadfastly the outlook upon life of one to
whom all life has been sanctified by that supreme
experience. “Who can read ‘The House of Life’”
(says Mr. F.W.H. Myers in his essay on “Rossetti
and the Religion of Beauty”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a>) “and not feel
that this poet has known love as love can be, not
an enjoyment only or a triumph, but a worship
and a regeneration?”</p>

<p class='c000'>In such a spirit does the poet take account of
time and opportunity, and recognize the solemnities
of passing hour. Life has become more sacred,
the man more responsible, the imperative forces of
character and destiny more urgent than before.
The sense of personal possibilities and shortcomings
weighs upon him. “Lost days” and wasted
chances oppress his mind. The actualities of evil
in his own sphere of being look darker in the face
of the recognized good:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The lost days of my life until to-day,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>What were they, could I see them on the street</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Lie as they fell? Would they be ears of wheat</div>
      <div class='line'>Sown once for food but trodden into clay?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Or golden coins squandered and still to pay?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Or drops of blood dabbling the guilty feet?</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Or such spilt water as in dreams must cheat</div>
      <div class='line'>The throats of men in Hell, athirst alway?</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I do not see them here, but after death</div>
      <div class='line in2'>God knows I know the faces I shall see,</div>
      <div class='line'>Each one a murdered self, with low last breath.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘I am thyself,—what hast thou done to me?’</div>
      <div class='line'>‘And I—and I—thyself,’ (lo! each one saith,)</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘And thou thyself to all eternity!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>And in a similar strain the poet prays:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O Lord of work and peace! O Lord of life!</div>
      <div class='line in2'>O Lord, the awful Lord of will! though late,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Even yet renew this soul with duteous breath:</div>
      <div class='line'>That when the peace is garnered in from strife,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The work retrieved, the will regenerate,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>This soul may see thy face, O Lord of death!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This sense of destiny it is, this keen perception—characteristic
of all true romance—of the reality
of the spiritual world, the transiency of earthly
joys and the insufficiency of external things, that
gives the persistent undertone of melancholy to
Rossetti’s love-sonnets, and more or less, indeed, to
all his poetry. He does not, perhaps, sustain the
peculiar minor key which the resigned and pensive
fatalism of William Morris imparts. His grasp of
fate is firmer, and with all his despair and doubt
and grief he keeps a greater dignity of front than
any of his surviving brother-poets. But his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>pessimism, if it must be called so, had its source in
a hyper-sensitive and self-conscious personality,
and was drawn, as one has said of Michaelangelo,
from “the struggle of a strong nature to attune
itself.” It is an absorbing struggle, on which to
look with reverent reserve; carried on within the
sorely-shaken spaces of a spirit too proud to vent
itself, as Swinburne’s, in a broad and vigorous
iconoclasm; too isolated to find relief, as the poet
of “The Earthly Paradise” was presently to do,
in the vanguard of a social revolution promising
the heaven of his dreams. Nor could Rossetti’s
wayward heart find permanent rest in the fervid
religious faith which sustained the poetess of the
Pre-Raphaelite movement—his sister, Miss Christina
Rossetti.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the sadness that tinges Rossetti’s verse is
nearly always of a kind that chastens without
enervating, and strengthens while it subdues. Intimately
personal and subtly introspective as it is,
it lifts us on to the highest planes of living poetry.
We feel that the writer has learnt that first great
lesson which indeed Rossetti himself has urged in
these sonnets,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“By thine own tears thy song must tears beget,</div>
      <div class='line'>O Singer!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>And by that baptism of tears he rises to the rank
of those whose individual loss and grief have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>blessed the world, as the death of Edward King
blessed it in Milton’s “Lycidas,” and in far greater
measure the death of Arthur Hallam blessed it in
Tennyson’s “In Memoriam.” For while sometimes
the expression of personal pain may be put into
such perfect art as to afford in its very poignancy
of feeling a sort of æsthetic consolation, the test of
the highest poetic grief is that it shall lose the
smart of personal injury in a strong sense of
brotherhood with fellow-sufferers, and shall translate
the revolt against individual pain into a wide
compassion with the sorrows of a nation or of all
humanity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor can we avoid comparison of “The House
of Life” with the two great kindred cycles of love-sonnets
in the English language,—the sonnets
of Shakespeare, and Mrs. Browning’s “Sonnets
from the Portuguese;” the one celebrating a
hopeless and desolating passion, the other a fortunate
and consummated love. Rossetti touches
both these precedents, in that he knew alike the
depths and heights, the hell and heaven, of that
passion of which the poets say,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All other pleasures are not worth its pain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>He enjoyed happiness, and suffered despair, not
merely in the outward circumstances of his love,
but in a more subtle and irretrievable way. The
fallacy dies hard, that leads us to imagine that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>unvaryingly sad and gloomy natures are the
supreme sufferers of the world. On the contrary,
the acuteness of pain is measured by its victim’s
capacity for mirth. And there are some natures
so finely organized, so highly-strung, that even joy
is almost painful to them. They cannot lose
themselves in a moment’s rapture, but are beset
with contrasts behind and before; are haunted
with the cost of every ecstasy, and rarely learn
that calm and self-possessing wisdom which is the
fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, and through
which may come at last, in many channels of
temperament, in many forms of faith and duty, the
power to subdue the evil to the good. Such were
Shelley and Keats, Leopardi and Heine, James
Thomson and Philip Bourke Marston: such also
was Dante Gabriel Rossetti.</p>
<p class='c000'>It would be superfluous to dwell at length on
the extraordinary richness of Rossetti’s metaphor
and simile. The imagery in the “House of Life”
is for the most part sensuous, fervid, and almost
tropical in colour and atmosphere. Here are a
crowd of variously portentous spirits,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... “Fame, whose loud wings fan the ashen Past</div>
      <div class='line'>To signal fires;”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... “Song, whose hair</div>
      <div class='line'>Blew like a flame and blossomed like a wreath;”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>... “Love, smiling to receive</div>
      <div class='line'>Along his eddying plumes the auroral wind;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>And—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... “Life herself, the spirit’s friend and love,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Even still as Spring’s authentic harbinger</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Glows with fresh hours for hope to glorify;</div>
      <div class='line'>Though pale she lay when in the winter grove</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Her funeral flowers were snowflakes shed on her</div>
      <div class='line in4'>And the red wings of frost-fire rent the sky.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>We follow the soul of the lover—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... “where wan water trembles in the grove,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the wan moon is all the light thereof,”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>... “o’er the sea of love’s tumultuous trance,”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Upon the devious coverts of dismay”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>across “death’s haggard hills”; among</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Shadows and shoals that edge eternity,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and through</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>... “that last</div>
      <div class='line'>Wild pageant of the accumulated past</div>
      <div class='line'>That clangs and flashes for a drowning man.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The superb climax just quoted terminates one
of the most vivid and haunting of the “House of
Life” series,—“The Soul’s Sphere,”—illustrative
of the vast range of consciousness known to one</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>“Who, sleepless, hath ... anguished to appease</div>
      <div class='line'>Tragical shadow’s realm of sound and sight</div>
      <div class='line'>Conjectured in the lamentable night,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and probes the memory for images whose calm
splendour may bring forgetfulness of self. The
subject is that of Wordsworth’s well-known sonnet,
“A flock of sheep that leisurely pass by;” and the
contrast between the visions conjured up by the
two very diverse poets exactly illustrates the
difference of temperament which set them at
opposite poetic poles. The mind of Wordsworth
rests in the contemplation of familiar things, gains
peace in the common incidents of pastoral life,
loves Nature best in her ordinary moods, and
seeks always the homeliest of consolations, the
most universal joys. The mind of Rossetti craves
ever for the superlative, the exceptional, the
intense, and can find no ease in anything very
simple and quiet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The value of a poet’s verdict on his own poems
is not always to be measured by his critical faculty
when applied to general literature. The friends
of Rossetti have been unanimous in his praise as
a critic both of prose and of poetry, though his
desultory reading and vehemence of judgment led
him sometimes into extravagances of worship or
condemnation, and blunted his discrimination of
relative merits in divergent schools. Hence his
persistent and quite explicable antipathy to Wordsworth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>and his exaggerated estimate of Chatterton
in later life. But in his criticism of his own work
it is inevitable that a poet should be somewhat
biassed by associations and memories bearing
upon its production. It is difficult to take seriously
Rossetti’s admission to the indiscreet admirer of
one of his shorter poems,—“You are right: ‘The
Cloud Confines’ <em>is</em> my very best thing.” Lyrically
unimpeachable indeed it is, though not more so
than the exquisite “Autumn Song,” “A New
Year’s Burden,” “Insomnia,” “Three Shadows,”
or “Sunset Wings;” and therefore are we fain
to take Rossetti’s judgment as based largely on
technical considerations when, in selecting his
own favourites from among the “House of Life”
series, he adds to the noble sonnet “Lost Days”
(already quoted) the less impassioned but more
coherent and melodious “Still-born Love,” “The
One Hope,” and “Known in Vain.” These
certainly excel in some of the highest qualities of
the sonnet form—unity of idea, and the steady set
of the rhythmic flow and ebb in motive and application;
though in none of these does the sestet
conform to the pure Guittonian model on three-rhyme-sounds,
blending the first and fourth,
second and fifth, and third and sixth lines in
a double tercet, as it does with signal success
in “Lost on Both Sides,” “The Portrait,” and
“Hope Overtaken;” and in only one out of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>chosen four (“The One Hope”) does Rossetti
attain what he personally preferred as the most
perfect order of sestet rhymes, based upon two
terminal sounds, and rhyming the first, fourth,
and fifth lines against the second, third, and sixth;
thus opening the sestet with a quatrain harmonizing
in structure with the octet above, and yet
avoiding the rhymed couplet at the close which
would remove the whole poem from the Italian
mould in which, despite many irregularities, nearly
all Rossetti’s sonnets are cast. The sestet of
“Lost Days” (like several others in the series)
exemplifies what is generally held to be the best
arrangement of the two-rhymed sestet in the
Guittonian form,—that in which the first, third,
and fifth terminals chime against the second,
fourth, and sixth. Admirable as these four sonnets
are, however, in clarity of thought and cumulative
power, it is doubtful whether they should rank
higher, from the broadest standards of poetry,
than “Lost on Both Sides,” “Lovesight,” “Mid-rapture,”
or “Supreme Surrender;” in all of
which the gathering force of the motive sweeps in
a fine torrent—mournful, searching, tender, or
triumphant—to its eddying close, and the best
tribute to the metrical art of each is that it
conveys so perfectly the inmost fulness of the
thought. Frequently, indeed, Rossetti ends a
sonnet with a rhymed couplet on a new terminal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>sound, following a Guittonian quatrain, as in
“Mid-Rapture,” “True Woman,” “Her Heaven,”
and “The Song-Throe;” or in some cases following
a Shakespearean quatrain after a Guittonian
octet, as, for instance, in “Venus Victrix” and
“The Love-Moon.” Very rarely does he compose
a whole sonnet in the Shakespearean measure,
namely, that in which the two rhyme-sounds of
the doubled-quatrained octave occur in alternate
lines, and the former of them is carried forward
with a new rhyme for the similarly alternated
quatrain of a sestet clenched with a rhyming
couplet on another note, as in “Willow-Wood”
(No. III.). The question of the legitimacy of
a rhymed couplet at the close of anything but a
wholly Shakespearean sonnet has been much
debated by conflicting authorities on poetic form.
The sonnet is at once the most elastic and the
most arbitrary of vehicles for the concise embodiment
of a single thought and its accessory similes.
From the scholar’s point of view, no indiscriminate
grafting of one essentially national and historic
growth of form upon another is theoretically
defensible. But, since no European language is of
exclusive stock, the fusion of Latin and Saxon
speech in the varied beauty of modern English
seems hardly less anachronistic than the adaptation
of traditional metres to the new requirements
of the poetic faculties of the age.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Akin to the “House of Life” in spirit and
substance is “The Portrait;” a reminiscence, after
the death of the loved model, of hours which saw
the painting of the picture on a stormy summer

      <div class='line'>Blind tears from the blind sky.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In “Dante at Verona” Rossetti portrays in a
somewhat diffuse and irregular string of descriptive
stanzas, some incidents, historic and imaginary,
but always congruous with our best ideals of
Dante,—of his exile from Florence and his sojourn
at the Court of Verona after the death of Beatrice.
The poem lacks balance and unity of plan, but
abounds in passages of exquisite feeling, wrought
through the keen vision of those significant accessories
that make a great, if fragmentary picture of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>the commanding personality so near akin in many
aspects to his modern namesake and disciple, yet
strangely removed from him in temperament and
character. How far in either case the lover’s
worship was fulfilled and consummated in a single
earthly embodiment of the ideal, or whether such
a brief apparent gain served but to feed the fires
of the insatiable idealism behind it, is hardly for
the historian to estimate. But whatever the actual
channels found by the dominant passion of their
poetry, however diverse the conditions under
which it sought its outlet towards the infinite sea,
both Dante and Rossetti may be counted with
the isolated band of dreamers, who, as Shelley
once said aptly of himself, “are always in love
with something or other; their error consists in
seeking in a mortal image the likeness of what is,
perhaps, eternal.” They “have loved Antigone
before they visited this earth, and are ever
demanding of life more than it can give.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On such a pilgrimage the sombre figure of
“Dante at Verona” passes before us, through
the palaces and gardens of Can Grande della
Scala, ever remote, self-absorbed, austere; “with
set brows lordlier than a frown;” and we are
shown his vigils, his spiritual isolation among the
gross luxuries and corruptions of the table, the
chamber, and the hall; and how his presence half
won, half awed the women of the court;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“And when the music had its sign</div>
      <div class='line'>To breathe upon them for more ease</div>
      <div class='line'>Sometimes he turned and bade it cease.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>And he who followed steadfastly the inward vision
of the lost Beatrice, to be regained in Paradise,
cherished with the more integrity his love for the
city of Beatrice,—Florence, that “sat solitary”
when Beatrice died, and now seemed lost also.
And he answered them that would win back the
exiled patriot-poet,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“That since no gate led, by God’s will,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To Florence, but the one whereat</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The priests and money-changers sat,</div>
      <div class='line'>He still would wander; for that still,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Even through the body’s prison-bars</div>
      <div class='line in2'>His soul possessed the sun and stars.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Here again is struck the keynote of romance,
“the note of resistance and defiance” of external
trammels and material bonds; the note of spiritual
courage which can pierce through the finite to the
infinite life, and “possess” what this world cannot
remove or bestow. And in this high strain the
personal accent, the autobiographic undertone,
loses itself in a loftier music, and “Dante at
Verona” is brought within measurable distance of
Rossetti’s finest work—his great romantic ballads,
“Rose Mary,” “The White Ship,” “The King’s
Tragedy,” “Sister Helen,” “The Bride’s Prelude,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>“The Staff and Scrip,” and “The Blessed
Damozel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Staff and Scrip,” perhaps, ranks next
above “Dante at Verona,” to which it links itself
as a kind of companion poem; celebrating the
life-long faithfulness of a lady to her knight-errant,
perished in defence of her cause. Coming as a
pilgrim through her wasted lands, the hero seeks
the queen in her dim palace, where,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The sweetness sickened her</div>
      <div class='line'>Of musk and myrrh,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and dedicates himself to the redemption of the
country from her foe.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“She sent him a sharp sword, whose belt</div>
      <div class='line in2'>About his body there</div>
      <div class='line'>As sweet as her own arms he felt.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>He kissed its blade, all bare,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Instead of her.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The knight wins in the battle, but dies in the
victory, and his body is brought to the queen.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Uncover ye his face,’ she said.</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘O changed in little space!’</div>
      <div class='line in1'>She cried; ‘O pale that was so red!</div>
      <div class='line in3'>O God, O God of grace!</div>
      <div class='line in5'>Cover his face.’</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“His sword was broken in his hand</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Where he had kissed the blade.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>‘O soft steel that could not withstand!</div>
      <div class='line in3'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>O my hard heart unstayed,</div>
      <div class='line in5'>That prayed and prayed!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The exaltation of spirit is more sustained, the
diction more finely distilled, the air clearer, the
whole balance and setting of the narrative more
perfect than in “Dante at Verona.” The passion
of chivalric love, worship, heroism, loyalty, burns
at a white-heat from the first line to the last.
Every phrase is purged, chastened, and full-charged;
and flies swiftly with its portentous
burden of meaning straight to the mark. It
breathes the very soul of that romantic chivalry
to which the modern world is turning with a
shaken conscience and a regenerate will; impelled
to a larger application of its principles than the
golden ages knew. The glory of true knighthood
in its championship of the weak, its resistance of
tyranny, its heroic self-sacrifice, its contempt of
ease, its defiance of pain, its devotion to principle,
is as yet a tardy sunrise brokenly discerned through
the long reaches of historic years; an unsteady
dawn of world-light clouded by men’s lust of
private power; a scant and partial gleam of what
it must involve for the social life to be.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The White Ship” and “The King’s Tragedy”
stand together as Rossetti’s sole and supreme
achievements in the realm of historical romance.
They stand, in fact, alone in conception and treatment
among modern English ballads: unequalled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>even by Tennyson’s “Revenge,” and crowning the
lyric with something almost of the epic quality.
The theme of “The White Ship” is found in the
familiar story of Henry I. of England, who is said
to have “never smiled again” after the loss of
the “white ship” in which his son and heir—not
mentioned by name in the poem—perished
in crossing the channel from Normandy. “The
King’s Tragedy” relates, through the mouth of
Catherine Douglas (“Kate Barlass”), the assassination
of James I. of Scotland by Sir Robert
Graeme. In neither ballad is the action lifted to
an unfamiliar or phantasmal world; in both it is
transfused, as it passes across the stage of actual
history, with a glow and glamour of supernatural
light; brought near to us with a direct realism of
incident and detail as convincing as it is transparent,
and yet shrouded in an atmosphere of mysticism
and reserve, pervaded with a sense of doom
and fatality, that holds us in a mingled awe and
exaltation such as we feel in the purest Greek
tragedy, amid the strivings of the gods with men.
The narrative of “The White Ship” is told
bluntly, vividly, incoherently, by the humblest of
the king’s retinue and the sole survivor of the
royal train, “the butcher of Rouen, poor Berold;”
and the movement seems to gather the more power
and sincerity from his untutored lips. Its dominant
motives, its finer touches,—the withholding of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>the hero’s name and the allusions to him merely as
“the Prince,” the emphasis on the manner of the
death of the “lawless, shameless youth” who died,
after all, for his sister’s sake—the emphasis
throughout on character rather than on incident—these
are true marks of romantic poetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>But “The King’s Tragedy” far surpasses the
earlier ballad in sustained and unfaltering dignity
of passion, in the tender humanness of the narrative
setting, the grandly simple presentation of the
climax, and the weird portent of the earlier scenes.
None but the two or three who saw the writer in the
course of his task can know what the poem cost
Rossetti in his dying year,—the last great product
of a literary genius still ascendant when obscured
by death, and if not the finest of all his ballads,
sharing at least the rank of “Sister Helen,” “Rose
Mary,” and “The Blessed Damozel.” Never does
he use the supernatural machinery with a more
masterly restraint or yet with a more powerful
effect of dread and presage, than when he brings
the aged woman of the sea, like one of the witches
of “Macbeth,” to confront the King with her
fourfold vision of his doom:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Then, in strange contrast to the wild scenery of
the “black beach-side” in winter, we are shown
the king and queen at home and keeping festival
in the ill-fated house. The revelry of the halls,
and the quiet joy of the hearthside, seem to
avert for a time the coming woe. The king takes
his harp, and sings to the queen an old love-song
which he had written to her from prison long ago.
But soon the boded fate falls on them unaware:</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>“’Twas a wind-wild eve in February,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>And muttered the driving rain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The entrance of the traitors, with “three hundred
armèd men,” urges on the climax of the tragedy,
until at last the king, discovered in the vault where
he had hastily hidden:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Half-naked stood, but stood as one</div>

      <div class='line'>The Knight was ’reft of his battle array,—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>But still the man was there!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The poem ends on a stern note of revenge and
retribution, for, when the shameful deed is done, the
queen keeps watch for a whole month beside the
royal body; refusing to permit the burial till every
one of the “murderous league” is put to a more
terrible death than his lord.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And then she said,—‘My King, they are dead!’</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And she knelt on the chapel floor,</div>
      <div class='line'>And whispered low with a strange proud smile,—</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘James, James, they suffered more!’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>There is, perhaps, a higher aspect to this passion
of revenge, this fierce, imperative, triumphant sense
of moral justice and supernatural retribution, than
the somewhat partial and personal form which it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>assumes in mediæval poetry. Beneath the crude
worship of arbitrary rule, behind the primitive conception
of a Power that for ever vindicates the
brave and puts the coward to confusion, lies the
germ of that larger sense of divine vengeance
which inspires and dominates all great tragedy.
Something of this higher strain of feeling, this
perception of the futility of merely human punishments
and personal judgments, yet mingled with
an instinctive acceptance of the human measures as
the instruments of the divine, finds expression in
the ballad of “Sister Helen.” The theme is based
upon an ancient superstition to the effect that the
death of a wrong-doer could be supernaturally
procured by the injured person, by making a waxen
image in his semblance and melting it for three
days and nights before a fire. Sister Helen’s
lover has been unfaithful to her, and in her anger
against him she melts his image and keeps her
dreadful watch relentlessly through the appointed
hours, till the spell is completed, and her vengeance
achieves its purpose in the death of her enemy.
The poem is cast in the form of a dialogue between
Sister Helen and her little brother, whose
childish wonder at the mysterious process distracts
him from his play; and he looks by turns at the
fatal fire and at the wintry landscape without.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The contrast between the boy’s innocent, eager
reports and observations, and Helen’s bitter,
mocking answers, carries with it all the solemn
terror of the Greek, and all the mystic naïveté of
the mediæval world. At last the unfaithful lover’s
aged father, and finally his three days’ bride, arrive
to add their entreaties for his life, and the lady
falls fainting at Helen’s inhospitable door.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>It is not until too late that Helen learns that by
seeking revenge for her own sorrow she has only
doubled the sin. Absorbed in her own heart’s
bitterness, she cannot know that the only anger
worthy to play a part in the divine retribution is
that which burns not so much for the sin against
self as for the sin against love; which draws from
the smart of personal injury a righteous indignation
for others’ wrongs, a profound and passionate pity
for fellow-victims of a too common evil, a too
familiar grief. But in Helen’s vengeance lies her
own despair:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Ah! what white thing at the door has crossed,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The same thought of reciprocal sin, if we may so
express it,—of the mutual responsibility of soul to
soul,—that subtle action of the law of vicarious
suffering by which every soul that falls short of its
own highest and best inevitably drags down some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>other soul with it,—and the converse thought of
individual redemption through mutual love: these
afford the motive of “Rose Mary.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Shame for shame, yea, and sin for sin:</div>

      <div class='line'>If love for love be found therein.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The story turns upon the magic properties attributed
to the Beryl-stone, into which the pure in
heart might look and read the future, and be forewarned
against all danger or calamity. Rose
Mary’s mother bids her read the mysterious crystal
on the eve of her lover’s journey to a distant shrine,
whither he rides to seek shrift for his soul before
the wedding-day. The mother fears some ambush
of foes by the way, and trusts the Beryl to reveal
where the danger lies. Unknown to her, however,
Rose Mary and her lover have joined in sin; and
their sin dispossesses the good spirits from the
stone, and yields their place to evil spirits, so that
the spell works by contraries, and the oracle speaks
falsely; the lover is betrayed and killed on the road
at night. But, unknown to Rose Mary, her lover
has been faithless, even to her own love. The sin
is threefold,—his with her, hers with him, and his
with another; and Rose Mary learns that only by
an heroic forgiveness and self-sacrifice which shall
cost her very life can she atone for her own and
his greater sin, win pardon for both, and cast out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>the evil tenants from the Beryl stone. The ballad
moves throughout at Rossetti’s highest poetic
level; its majestic rhythm sweeps from verse to
verse in a torrent of swift, strong, lyric narrative,
almost too cohesive for quotation, save in such
descriptive stanzas as these:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Even as she spoke, they two were ’ware</div>
      <div class='line'>Of music-notes that fell through the air;</div>
      <div class='line'>A chiming shower of strange device,</div>
      <div class='line'>Drop echoing drop, once, twice, and thrice,</div>
      <div class='line'>As rain may fall in Paradise.</div>
      <div class='line'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>
      <div class='line'>As the globe slid to its silken gloom,</div>
      <div class='line'>Once more a music rained through the room;</div>
      <div class='line'>Low it splashed like a sweet star-spray,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sobbed like tears at the heart of May,</div>
      <div class='line'>And died as laughter dies away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>But the imagery from first to last is of extraordinary
tenderness and power; as, for instance, in
describing the first lightning-flash before a storm,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ere labouring thunders heave the chain</div>
      <div class='line'>From the flood-gates of the drowning rain,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>or when,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The dawn broke dim on Rose Mary’s soul,—</div>
      <div class='line'>No hill-crown’s heavenly aureole,</div>
      <div class='line'>But a wild gleam on a shaken shoal,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and in the past night,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“She knew she had waded bosom-deep</div>
      <div class='line'>Along death’s bank in the sedge of sleep.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>It is impossible to adequately criticise “Rose
Mary” without reference to the question already
raised by Mr. Theodore Watts, as to whether in
future editions of Rossetti’s poems the “Beryl
Songs” should not be removed from their present
places in the interludes of the poem and relegated
to a note at the end. Writing on this point in
the “Athenæum,” Mr. Watts said:—“The only case
in which Rossetti’s changes were not improvements
was the case of the changes in ‘Rose
Mary,’ made, not after, but before, it appeared in
type,—changes which can only be called lamentable.
It had lain in its perfect form for years, and
although it had been read in manuscript to scores
of friends, no line in it had been altered. But
when passing ‘Ballads and Sonnets’ through
the press in 1881, at a time when he was out
of health, Rossetti called to mind certain remarks
upon a supposed lack of clarity in his work which
had fallen not only from some critics but from
certain friends; and in an evil moment it occurred
to him that it would be a gain to ‘Rose Mary’ if
the three parts were knit together by lyrics, and
he set to work to write the ‘Beryl Songs’ which
now appear in the ballad. The lyrics themselves
are not good, for his endowment of metre was not
equal to his other poetical gifts; but had they
been as good as the lyrics in ‘Maud’ the disaster
to the poem would have been none the less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>grievous. A friend whom at that time he consulted
upon everything strongly fought against the
introduction of these incongruities, but Rossetti
was too ill to be persistently opposed, and only
became conscious of the mistake when it was
too late, the book being then before the public.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is obvious that the friend here alluded to is
Mr. Watts himself, and it must be remembered
that inasmuch as every line of the ballad <em>without</em>
the lyrics had been familiar to him for years, his
verdict can hardly be accepted as that of an unbiassed
judge. It is, at all events, dubious whether
any editor would now presume to disturb the
sequence of the poem.</p>

<p class='c000'>In one other ballad of kindred structure does
Rossetti sustain a similar flow of exquisite imagination,
in verbal beauty and subtlety of idiom
hard to surpass in modern English verse. “The
Bride’s Prelude” is indeed but a lovely fragment,
a delicate vignette, a little character-sketch bathed
in the warmest and finest of mediæval colouring;
a prelude only, as it modestly claims to be; but,
like Chopin’s preludes in music, so perfect in its
limited range that the ear craves no further melody
for a long while after its brief passion has sung
itself to rest. It is a bride’s confession to her
younger sister on her wedding morn; and, taking
the form of a broken monologue interspersed with
descriptive passages of the highest poetic order,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>its movement is more deliberate, its ornament
more richly wrought, perhaps, than that of the
more dramatic ballads. It might almost be said
that nowhere else does Rossetti so oppress the
reader with the actual feeling of the atmosphere
in which the tale is told. The intense and sultry
stillness of the chamber at mid-noon, where the
two women sit together probing for the first and
only time the one dire secret of the past, weighs
upon us like veritable glare and burning silence,
save for the bride’s difficult speech, and the
shocked sister’s faint answers, and the keen, far-off
sounds in the courtyard below, till the last
word is said. Every minute detail of sight and
sound heightens the effect of warmth and colour
in contrast to the bare simplicity and hard tragedy
of the narrative.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The room lay still in dusty glare,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Having no sound through it</div>
      <div class='line'>Except the chirp of a caged bird</div>
      <div class='line'>That came and ceased: and if she stirred,</div>
      <div class='line'>Amelotte’s raiment could be heard.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Although the lattice had dropped loose,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>There was no wind; the heat</div>
      <div class='line'>Being so at rest that Amelotte</div>
      <div class='line'>Heard far beneath the plunge and float</div>
      <div class='line'>Of a hound swimming in the moat.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Some minutes since, two rooks had toiled</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Home to the nests that crowned</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Ancestral ash-trees. Through the glare</div>
      <div class='line'>Beating again, they seemed to tear</div>
      <div class='line'>With that thick caw the woof o’ the air.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Such fragments afford the merest glimpses of the
background, the pure, delicate, ultra-refined, and
yet intensely naturalistic setting of the poem.</p>

<p class='c000'>And indeed it is this highest refinement of
naturalism, this perfect idealization of realities,
this raising of the simplest and commonest
accessories of life into universal beauty and significance,
that remains Rossetti’s inmost, utmost
charm. This it is that sends us back, again and
again, from all the splendours of his maturity,
from the vivid glories of the ballads and the
long-drawn passion of the sonnets, to the primal
sweetness and utter simplicity of “The Blessed
Damozel;” the easiest to love, the hardest to
place in a just order, amid all that came from the
hand and heart of Rossetti.</p>

<p class='c000'>Written in his nineteenth year (though re-touched
with important improvements afterwards), while
the ballads above referred to were the work of his
maturity,—and as remote from them in spirit as
in date, the poem is unique among unique poetry.
“The Blessed Damozel” is no product of precocity.
It has not the laboured archaism, the studied
originality, which mark most of the travel-poems of
1849 (“Paris and Belgium,” “Antwerp and
Bruges,” etc.). Superb as are the sonnets of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>early period—such noble utterances as “The
Staircase of Notre Dame,” “Place de la Bastille,”
and “The Refusal of Aid between Nations” remaining
unsurpassed by anything in the “House
of Life” series—the irregular lyrics and blank-verse
chronicles of those journeys are apt to keep
us in mind of those etymological researches at the
British Museum by which Rossetti is said to have
stored his vocabulary with the purest Saxon, preparatory
to ballad-work. “The Blessed Damozel,”
on the contrary, is the most spontaneous and convincing
of all his shorter poems. It seems to have
sprung straight from the heart of the boy-poet in
a sort of prophetic rapture, ere he knew the sorrow
which he sang, and which his song should ease, as
the most perfect art can sometimes ease, in other
souls, for generations to come. Its strength lies
in the very acme of tenderness; its source in the
purest strain of common human feeling—the
passionate, insatiable craving of the faithful heart
for the continuity of life and love beyond the tomb,
and the deep sense of the poverty of celestial
compromises to satisfy the mourner on either side
of the gulf that Death has set between. Here
again is the true romantic note—the insistence on
the joy and glory of the physical world, the delight
in the earthly manifestations of affection, and the
awed, plaintive conflict of impatience with resignation
under the mystery of parting and transition to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>an unknown state. It is the same thought which
an American poet has expressed in “Homesick in
Heaven,”—the thought that the beloved departed
must in some way share the sorrow of separation,
and await the last reunion with scarcely less longing
than theirs whom they have left behind. “The
Blessed Damozel” is one whom Death has thus
removed from her lover’s side, and she is pictured
leaning out of Heaven, watching with tears and
prayers for some sign of his coming. It is the
lover himself who sees her thus, as in a dream,
and tells us how,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“She bowed herself, and stooped</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Out of the circling charm,</div>
      <div class='line'>Until her bosom must have made</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The bar she leaned on warm,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>and how, on the mystic borderland between earth
and heaven,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The souls mounting up to God</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Went by her like thin flames.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The glories of the upper air have no charm for
her until he shares them. Still gazing downward
from “the ramparts of God’s house,” she sees—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The tides of day and night</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With flame and darkness ridge</div>
      <div class='line'>The void, as low as where this earth</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Spins like a fretful midge;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>she knows the angels who “sit circlewise”—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To fashion the birth-robes for them</div>
      <div class='line'>Who are just born, being dead!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>Her one prayer is for the old companionship, the
old, simple, earthly happiness,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Only to live as once on earth</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With Love,—only to be,</div>
      <div class='line'>As then awhile, for ever now,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Together, I and he.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It was not until many years later that “The
Blessed Damozel” afforded the subject of the
picture by which Rossetti is most popularly and
superficially known to the outer world. It was his
habit to inscribe his pictures with some original
verse, generally in sonnet form; and some of his
best descriptive sonnets, such as “Pandora,”
“Fiametta,” “Found,” “Astarte Syriaca,” and
“Mary Magdalene,” had such an origin. “The
Blessed Damozel” is said to be only instance of a
picture executed after instead of before the correlative
poem.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two important works stand yet apart, alike
from what we have classed as introspective and
personal poetry, and from the splendid ballads in
which consists Rossetti’s most immortal contribution
to English literature. “Jenny” and “A
Last Confession” exemplify his use of the dramatic
monologue, and alone among his compositions bear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>in a marked degree the influence of Browning.
Especially is this influence notable in “A Last
Confession.” The Italy of this wonderful
fragment—placed by critics of authority in the front
rank of Rossetti’s work—is, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>par excellence</em></span>, Browning’s
Italy, with all the intense humanness and distinction
of character which dominates its furies and
its loves, with all the Saxon intellect and reason
stamped into and burning through the irresponsible
passion of the South. Just as in his ballads and
sonnets Rossetti grafted the clean-cut Saxon
diction on to the long and languorous habit of the
Latin tongue, so in “A Last Confession” does he
graft vivid thought and piercing argument upon
the deep pathos and terror of the theme. It is a
death-bed story told in a priest’s ear; a story of
passion and crime, and of a girl’s shallow laugh
that drove her lover to kill her in a frenzy of
despair. For he remembered how, awhile before,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in12'>... “A brown-shouldered harlot leaned</div>
      <div class='line'>Half through a tavern window thick with wine.</div>
      <div class='line'>Some man had come behind her in the room</div>
      <div class='line'>And caught her by the arms, and she had turned</div>
      <div class='line'>With that coarse empty laugh on him....</div>
      <div class='line in12'>... And three hours afterwards,</div>
      <div class='line'>When she that I had run all risks to meet</div>
      <div class='line'>Laughed as I told you, my life burned to death</div>
      <div class='line'>Within me, for I thought it like the laugh</div>
      <div class='line'>Heard at the fair....</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>And all she might have changed to, or might change to,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seemed in that laugh.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Somewhat akin in spirit (though less dramatic
in treatment), in that it deals with the problem
of sexual love in its darkest form, is the rhymed
monologue entitled “Jenny;” and put into the
mouth of one who has followed, half in pity, half
in curiosity, a beautiful courtesan to her home,
and sits with her in the luxurious chamber which
is the purchase of her shame. The poem is to
some extent in obvious relation to Rossetti’s
long contemplated but never completed picture,
“Found;” but the latter shows the end of poor
Jenny in after years,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When, wealth and health slipped past, you stare</div>
      <div class='line'>Along the streets alone, and there,</div>
      <div class='line'>Round the long park, across the bridge,</div>
      <div class='line'>The cold lamps at the pavement’s edge,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wind on together and apart,</div>
      <div class='line'>A fiery serpent for your heart,”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>whereas her visitor in the poem finds her in all
her prime and pride, and asks,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“What has man done here? How atone</div>
      <div class='line'>Great God, for this which man has done?</div>
      <div class='line'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</div>
      <div class='line'>But if, as blindfold fates are tossed</div>
      <div class='line'>Through some one man this life be lost,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall soul not somehow pay for soul?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>“Jenny,” perhaps, being cast in a more meditative
form, lacks the poignancy and fervour of
the utterance which comes, in “A Last Confession,”
from the lips of the sinner himself instead of from
the spectator merely, but it surpasses all contemporary
studies of its kind in its bold and masterly
handling of a difficult theme. Both, however, are
distinct from the lyric poems in that their abruptness
of movement and irregularity of structure
are the abruptness and irregularity of quick
dramatic thought, impatient of metrical elaboration,
surcharging the poetic vehicle with subject matter;
an effect which must not be confused with the
ruggedness of the true ballad-form, whose broken
music haunts the ear by its very waywardness
and variety of rhythm, and gains its end by a
studied artlessness the more exquisite for its
apparent unconstraint. Nor is the effect of Rossetti’s
universal preference for assonance over
rhyme—a special characteristic of romantic poetry—identical
in the ballads, sonnets and monologues
just quoted. In the sonnets it relieves the rigid
tension of the rhyme-system with an overtone of
delicate caprice. In “Jenny” and “A Last Confession”
it heightens the suggestion of impulse,
and even haste of thought and emotion outrunning
the metrical order which it chose. In the ballads,
it is the result of the finest workmanship, not of
accident or pressure of thought upon speech; it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>the rich inlaying of the most highly-wrought woof
of imaginative language with the brilliance of a
perpetual surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rossetti is too near to us for a final estimate of
his place among the century’s poets. Enough has
been said to illustrate the range and consistency
of his art, as a whole, and the intimate relation of
his poetry to his painting. The dominant æsthetic
motives are the same in “Dante’s Dream” and
“The House of Life,” in “Dis Manibus” and
“The King’s Tragedy,” in “Beata Beatrix” and
“The Blessed Damozel.” He was the prophet
of a natural idealism, based upon the frank acceptance
and pursuit of the highest earthly good,
subject only and absolutely to moral and spiritual
law. He stood apart, as we have seen, from the
intellectual struggles of his day. Philosophical
controversies seldom troubled him. To theological
speculation and historical discovery he was alike
indifferent. But his isolation, his specialism even,
are but evidences of the intensity of the new life to
which he was awakened, and the reality of the
visions which he saw. He sets before us in all its
significance the problem of the dual possibilities
of womanhood, by the simple, irresistible, pictorial
statement of the contrast between the shameful
actuality of “Found” and the noble ideal of
“Sibylla Palmifera” and “Monna Vanna.” His
lamentation for the manhood of his age is that,—</p>

<p class='c017'>Such words are but the reiteration of that moral
collectivism, that principle that “soul must somehow
pay for soul,” which Rossetti maintains unbrokenly
as an assumption needing neither emphasis nor
reserve. The problem which his work leaves to
the next generation lies in the application of that
principle to social and national ideals. The task
of the twentieth century will be to do for society
what Rossetti has done for art,—to restore to it
the dignity and glory of a free life, embracing all
that nature has to give, under the dominion of
associated reason, and conscience, and will. And
when Rossetti’s genius shall have fulfilled its share
in that unification of all knowledge to which the
paths of science and poetry, art and scholarship,
tend alike in the progress of time, England and
Italy may join in worthier recognition of his life-work,
whose face was set towards the final triumph
of humanity—the reconciliation of the physical
with the spiritual world.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
